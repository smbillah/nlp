GREG MATTHEWS, the all-rounder, will fly to India to replace Tim May, the injured off-spinner, in Australia's squad playing in the Nehru Trophy one-day tournament. 
May, who injured his <tag "516619">knee</> against the West Indies last Saturday, has returned home for surgery.   

800002
Janice Raymond from the Institute of Women and Technology, based in the US, urges us to take a more critical look at RU 486 in particular, and reproductive technology as a whole. 
She warns against what can sometimes be a <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> support of abortion technology for fear of playing into the hands of the right wing. 

800003
We were invited to Kim Philby's funeral and said we'd go, but the day was changed and we'd flown to Lvov in the Ukraine. 
WE met more writers and admired the beautiful town and visited the cathedral which was crowded with old women, many on their <tag "516631">knees</>.   

800004
`Sounds like a conspiracy." 
Jo pulled one <tag "516619">knee</> up to her chest and hugged it thoughtfully, reflecting on the hard-won flatness of her own belly.   

800005
Bull, who has scored four goals in the last two games, did not train yesterday after picking up the injury during Saturday's 5-0 win over Portsmouth. 
Bull's absence would be a big disappointment for Wolves as his fellow striker, Andy Mutch, is almost certain to be sidelined for the third game in a row with a groin injury. 
However, defender Nicky Clarke and midfielder Mick Gooding should have recovered from <tag "517036">knee</> injuries in time.   

800006
The conversation had to be what he called `bawdry. 
`Nothing above the belly or below the <tag "516619">knee</> tonight!" he exclaimed on one of these evenings, savouring the rowdy songs and bawdy rhymes which resulted.   

800007
`When you get up in the morning, you just don't feel as pain-free as you used to." 
`No matter how good a shape you get in, the muscles just don't recover quite as quickly," added the woman who has maintained her pre-eminence in world tennis despite a constant battle with a `beat-up" <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800008
He finished the stage more than 14 minutes down on Indurain. 
`I hit my bad left <tag "516619">knee</> on the handle-bars after eight kilometres when the chain slipped," he said, which seemed, as one Irish journalist remarked, `a feeble excuse".   

800010
The acting company reminds me of recent England cricket teams: strong openers and a good tail but weak in the middle order. 
David Bradley is his usual excellent self as Morose: a vinegary sourpuss who expects his servant Mute (a very funny Graham Turner) to communicate with him by means of flexing his right <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800011
It was too late to stop Panov from entering the inner circle of the meeting ground but perhaps not too late to get them both out! 
The retired intelligence officer reached under his jacket for the small Baretta automatic that was his constant companion, and lurched rapidly forward, limping and flailing his cane against the crowd, smashing <tag "516668">kneecaps</> and prodding stomachs and breasts and kidneys until the stunned, angry strollers erupted in successive cries of shock, a near riot in the making. 

800012
Too early to go from Rington Square to the television studios where she was to be filmed by Frances Keene, she was drawn to Wilson's flat. 
This time she concentrated on the <tag "516743">kneehole</> desk in the bedroom, lifting out Wilson's papers a batch at a time, flicking through them, keeping the batches in order.   

800013
Buddie kicked an upright chair into a more suitable position and reached for his guitar. 
Carefully, almost lovingly, he pulled the instrument across his <tag "516632">knees</> and began to pluck at the strings with a plectrum fashioned from tortoise-shell. 

800014
The 5-0 defeat here precipitated the Dutchman's departure to Ajax, and Toshack has spent the last few days stressing the need for defensive discipline against opponents capable of producing goals from all positions. 
Ruud Gullit, orchestrator of Milan's triumph in April, is absent with a serious <tag "517036">knee</> injury which is expected to keep him out until the New Year, but Van Basten, Rijkaard, Ancelotti and Donadoni, all of whom scored six months ago, will be there again tonight to test a five-man defence which now has Bernd Schuster, the experienced West German midfield player, cementing the cracks as libero. 

800015
Manchester City officially approach Oldham Athletic with a view to recruiting their manager, Joe Royle. 
Ruud Gullit, of Milan and The Netherlands, voted World footballer of the Year this week, undergoes his third <tag "517036">knee</> operation in eight months.   

800016
Sunderland v Bournemouth Sunderland will be unchanged if Gates (toe injury) and MacPhail (stomach upset) pass fitness tests. 
Watford v WBA Hodges (ankle) and Wilkinson (<tag "516619">knee</>) are doubtful for Watford.   

800017
Barnes is not the only worry for Robson. 
Barnes's club-mate Steve McMahon has a problem with his ankle and the forceful midfielder joined the Tottenham pair of Gary Lineker (<tag "516619">knee</>) and Paul Gascoigne (calf) in the trip to Fred Street's physio bench yesterday.   

800018
Gavaldon has a different superstition for each event in which she plays. 
`This week I have taken to going down on one <tag "516631">knee</> in the bath in the mornings," she said. 

800019
The Bills stayed top of the AFC East with a one-game lead over the Miami Dolphins. 
EUGENE GILKES, the 27-year-old Newham decathlete, was drafted into England's Commonwealth Games team yesterday because of the withdrawal of Daley Thompson, his clubmate, following a <tag "517036">knee</> operation.   

800020
Without Nashwan, the chief British-trained challenger in the Arc will be Aliysa, who is competing with the recent winner of the Prix Vermeille, Young Mother, for favouritism. 
Cacoethes, whose partner has yet to be confirmed, and Carroll House, for whom the going is likely to be a little on the fast side, are also certain runners, but Luca Cumani will not decide until today whether Legal Case will take his chance. 
The Maktoums' main hope is now In The Wings, who has spent most of the season recuperating from an operation on a chipped <tag "516619">knee</>. 

800021
Kylie's drawing was deliberately childlike. 
She presented  herself as a mass of curly hair, decorated with huge teeth and  knobbly <tag "516619">knees</>.  

800022
Livewear will come in rather muted mossy and lichen-like colours. 
Dreadco designers plan to seed it in subtle initial patterns which will slowly grow and change, especially at underarms, <tag "516619">knees</>, elbows, and other moist or dirt-trapping areas. 

800023
That was all, there didn't seem to be much to sing for. 
The arthritis, an inherited complaint, was painful in both <tag "516619">knees</>, she had slept fitfully, disturbed by nightmares, and now she was to go and spend a distressing afternoon with Eleanor.   

800025
BORIS BECKER, the Wimbledon and US Open champion, enjoyed an encouraging return to Grand Prix play yesterday when he beat Milan Srejber in the first round of the Paris Open. 
Fluid on the <tag "516619">knee</> and a visit to his girlfriend's grandparents in East Germany have restricted him to just two exhibition matches since his triumph at Flushing Meadow.   

800026
The club now stands framed on his mantlepiece at home, a monument to the eternal perfidy of golfers. 
Wigan are optimistic that their Great Britain winger Henderson Gill, who has gone into hospital for an exploratory <tag "517036">knee</> operation, will be fit for the start of the season.   

800027
The women's championship has been thrown open by an injury to Wendy Botha, the South African-born Australian resident, who leads the standings from Bondi's Pauline Menczer. 
Botha, world champion in 1987, dislocated her left <tag "516619">knee</> in Newcastle, while Menczer won the contest.   

800028
He said: `I concluded that the leg had been separated from the thigh by a clean cut. 
I say this because the <tag "516668">kneecap</> had been divided in two without crushing the bone, and also because the edge of the cartilage in the joint was sharp and linear, not irregular."   

800029
Michael returned to his seat, his eyes glazed, feeling like a sleep-walker in the alarming silence which followed his words. 
He fell on his <tag "516631">knees</> with the others and prayed the prayer for quietness of mind, which was at such moments all that he could compass.   

800030
The upper rooms were silent when he finally went to his own room, but before getting into bed he pushed his wedge of broken chair-leg under the door to keep the Bogeyman out. 
HE WAS NOT ALLOWED to go to school again until Thursday morning, by which time the missing button had been replaced on the collar of his shirt and he was wearing a pair of smart new shoes of polished black leather and <tag "517085">knee-length</> grey socks with a dark red band around their tops.   

800031
Vivienne Westwood's Kings Road shop changed its name yet again to become World's End, and started showing collections. 
The 1980 collection was the pirate look: white frilly shirts and baggy <tag "517085">knee</> length trousers devised for Adam Ant, collected by the V &and. A, and much favoured by those of a New Romantic persuasion.   

800032
Axcell made a bad decision on Saturday &dash. one which could have had tragic repercussions. 
As the first half drew to a close, Rocastle had the wind knocked out of him by a heavy collision with Jimmy Carter, and sank to his <tag "516631">knees</>, clearly in need of assistance. 

800033
He must tell them nothing. 
Even if they locked him in a dark cell and pulled out all his teeth with rusty pliers, he must keep his promise to Sweetheart and tell them nothing. 
His heart leaped and his <tag "516619">knees</> trembled with relief when he heard the unmistakable sound of her footsteps rounding the corner at the other side of the cinema building.   

800034
`You have to call it a day some time and I shall be looking for a job in the Bristol area," said the 37-year-old Gloucestershire and Kent paceman. 
MIDFIELD player Mark Proctor of Middlesbrough will miss the start of the season after undergoing <tag "517036">knee</> and hernia operations.   

800037
The next morning, a Sunday, he agreed to Dick's suggestion to see a West German doctor, had tests done the following Wednesday and was referred to Zurich for an operation a week later. 
`They said I'd just got 50-60 years wear out of the <tag "516619">knee</> in 15 years."   

800038
Justin Fashanu, the former Norwich and Nottingham Forest striker, scored three and Clive Allen two in Manchester City's 5-0 home win against Notts County in a reserve match. 
Fashanu is on trial with City after a knee injury. 
Ruud Gullit flew back to Milan from Amsterdam yesterday to resume light training after a Brussels specialist confirmed he would not need further surgery on a nagging <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800039
Hucker, who joined the London club in November, made fine saves from Paul Byrne and Joey Beauchamp as United cut Millwall's defence to pieces, their pressure rewarded after 19 minutes. 
From Byrne's corner kick Matthew McDonnell pounced at the far post and headed in Colin Greenall's back header. 
Millwall, who lost Nicky Coleman after 34 minutes with damaged <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments, were restricted to long range shots which never troubled Alan Judge and early in the second half Hucker again rescued his side with a great save from Paul Evans. 

800040
I could barely stand up. 
My <tag "516619">knees</> almost gave out.  

800041
In fact it's the cheapest body exfoliator around! 
Walking barefoot on the beach helps to smooth rough, calloused feet. 
And, if the sand particles are fine, spend five minutes a day massaging them over the rest of your body, paying particular attention to areas where the skin is thicker and tends to be dry, such as elbows and <tag "516619">knees</>. 

800042
It all appears perfectly timeless but, like so much British pageantry, it is a relatively modern creation. 
The honour itself, however, dark velvet and buckled just below the <tag "516619">knee</> on the left leg, is genuinely ancient, for the Garter is the second oldest decoration, founded by Edward III in about 1348.  

800043
The rock hard surface, with its uneven bounce, caused a few problems for defenders and forwards alike but Abingdon were prepared to pressure Banstead at every opportunity and much of the impetus came from their forward-looking defence. 
Eddie Innes, who shrugged off a <tag "517036">knee</> injury to be fit, played in place of the unwell Kelvin Alexis in the heart of Abingdon's defence. 

800044
Egerton Grey is at Porthkerry, nr Cardiff, South Glamorgan. 
More than 600 runners, 100 cyclists, 22 horses and riders, but only one Jack Russell; horsepower, pedal power, <tag "517036-x">knee</> power and paw power compete for supremacy in a cross-country marathon.   

800045
When we came back, his car wasn't there waiting for him (because he's used to having a limo waiting for him to take him back to his hotel, but this day there was none), so he, Coco, his personal assistant, his photographer Denis O'Regan and one of the production assistants, Kim, had to look for a taxi, but they couldn't find one. 
All they could find was one of those scooter taxis which are really meant for two people, but they did manage to get four people into the two-seater, and the superstar and the others got in there on their <tag "516631">knees</> and went through the crowd. 

800046
DR GEORGE CAREY, the charistmatic new Archbishop of Canterbury, rediscovered God at the age of 37 in Toronto, Canada. 
As he fell on his <tag "516631">knees</>, saying he could not go on, he heard God speak to him in a still small voice. 

800047
You shouldn't have said that." 
A movement in the room beyond caused her to fly along the corridor, and as she was passing the kitchen door she blew out the candle and groped her way to her own door. 
Once inside, she almost threw the candle onto the bedside table, then, dropping onto her <tag "516631">knees</> by the side of the bed, she buried her head in her folded arms, and as her crying racked her body she groaned out her feelings; but there was no condemnation for either of her parents, only a deep sorrowing sadness.   

800048
But, it went on: `Some (Islamic scholars) suggest that he may look at her face and the lower part of her hands, while others say that he may look at her when she is in the normal dress she wears at home. 
This means she may be without her headcover or may be wearing a <tag "517085">knee-length</> dress."   

800049
The faith of Graeme Souness in his team's ability was demonstrated by the fact that there was only one change from the side beaten by Aberdeen, and an enforced one at that. 
Mark Walters badly damaged a <tag "516619">knee</> on Sunday and was replaced by Ian McCall.   

800050
He kept to the main road until a little short of Cerne Abbas when he pulled off, cut the engine and slid across to the passenger seat. 
Using as a rest the copy of Yachting World he had bought that morning, he opened the rent book on his <tag "516632">knees</> and with a black ballpoint pen filled in one column with a series of figures, the same figures each time. 

800051
He hesitated, then came forward. 
Craig Osbourne moved too, an arm around the throat, <tag "516619">knee</> up into the spine, arching Vogel backwards like a bow. 

800052
And how, come to think of it, was Henry going to get him to absorb the stuff, short of creeping up on him while he was asleep and forcing it down his throat or up his arse? 
He stopped for a moment, the crumpled sheet of prescription pad on his <tag "516632">knee</>, and wondered whether Donald was really worth all this effort.   

800053
`Bob, what about you?" says Philip, swivelling his head in the opposite direction. 
Bob Busby had also concluded his business at the urinal, but is adjusting his dress with a great deal of fumbling and <tag "516619">knee-flexing</>, as if his member is of such majestic size that it can be coaxed back into his Y- fronts only with the greatest difficulty.   

800054
It was also during this period that he began to disclose to Arthur some of his more bizarre sexual preferences and fantasies. 
In January 1917, his hand wobbles and he apologizes for his poor handwriting, poor because `it is being done across my knee". 
The very phrase is enough to set off in his mind a train of sado-masochistic reflections: `Across my <tag "516632">knee</>" of course makes one think of positions for whipping: or rather not for whipping (you couldn't get any swing) but for that torture with brushes.   

800056
I stayed until dark, until the moon came up or the first star. 
He walked home, but he did not try to kiss one or put his hand on the tickly part at the back of the <tag "516619">knee</>, the way other men did, even the teacher's first cousin, who pretended he wasn't doing it when he was. 

800057
Irina's face, which had been stiff, stony, suddenly gleamed, her eyes narrowed, splintered and glittered, then opened wide, her mouth relaxed. 
She looked down at the floor and made the slightest movement with one hand. 
Ludens instantly knelt down, first gracefully on one <tag "516631">knee</>, then less gracefully on two, his head thrown back.   

800059
Day left the ground on crutches, but yesterday gave himself a 50-50 chance of playing. 
Meanwhile, Wolves will be without Floyd Streete, the former Derby County and Cambridge United defender, for at least two weeks after an exploratory <tag "517036">knee</> operation.   

800060
Jean and Joy charge #15 a session, the minimum recommended by their professional body. 
For footballer Andrew Dawson, it's money well spent, as physiotherapy is his only hope rescuing his playing career after a devastating knee injury. 
Andrew, who was about to play top league amateur football with Bicester, was stretchered off with a <tag "517036">knee</> injury playing for Old Woodstock just under a year ago. 

800062
He also provided me with the feed-line to the only riposte of my life that I am proud of. 
Tripping over his stick at lunchtime in the pub, Hugo grabbed my <tag "516619">knee</> and with his Augustan turn of phrase murmured courteously `Beg pardon, madam, I intended no intimacy." 

800064
This is Japan after all; part of the mystery, and so on. 
If you want to wash yourself you can go to the real bathroom, usually en suite. 
In there you'll find a sink on the floor, just large enough to stand in, and you can have a good long soak up to your <tag "516619">knees</>.  

800065
`Yes, Countess." 
Maresa dropped to her <tag "516631">knees</>.   

800066
She runs into a thicket and, crouching, hides under the trees out of their sight. 
She can hear them shouting and she thinks that they are calling to her, and now on hands and <tag "516627">knees</> she starts to crawl through the underbrush and make her way by a hidden route back to the town.   

800068
Sentimental, she cried, look who's talking! 
The man whose <tag "516709-x">knees</> go weak at the sound of Jennifer Rush, the man who believes in love at first fuck.   

800070
Mr Lawson's surmise that she could not believe he meant what he said is plausible. 
So often, ministers had bent the <tag "516655">knee</> to her. 

800071
Will Carling leads England against Fiji on 4 November having played only one game in October after suffering concussion. 
Hopes of a return today were ruined when Harlequins' game against London Scottish was cancelled after a fixture mix-up. 
David Barnett, the Rosslyn Park hooker, faces a long lay-off after fracturing a <tag "516668">kneecap</> in last weekend's league match against Bath at the Recreation Ground.  

800072
Your reports today quite rightly praise the efforts being made in Sheffield to extract energy from waste and to recycle paper, glass, plastics and steel cans. 
Much as I wanted to read the good news on my walk home from the newspaper shop, I was forced to concentrate on my footing on broken and delapidated pavements, strewn with take-away food rubbish, wrappings of all kinds, and collections of weeds, heaps of dog dirt and drinks cans. 
In a few weeks' time, the fallen leaves will have risen from ankle to <tag "516678">knee</> deep.   

800073
Both horses are owned by Hamdan Al-Maktoum, but Stewart will be hoping he has found a suitable opening for the so far disappointing colt Yaazi, who runs in the colours of Hamdan's younger brother Sheikh Ahmed. 
Yaazi looked an interesting prospect when winning his maiden by three lengths at Newmarket last August, but he suffered a <tag "517036">knee</> injury shortly afterwards and wasn't seen out again.  

800074
The Rams were consequently knocked off the top of the NFC West, and the San Francisco 49ers, whom they defeated two weeks ago, took over sole possession of first place with a 37-20 win over the New England Patriots. 
It was a home game for San Francisco, but their home is Candlestick Park, so the game was moved to nearby Stanford University. 
The 49ers had little trouble with the Patriots, but may have lost their quarterback Joe Montana for two weeks with a hyper-extended <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800075
England, up until now as error-free as Lord Ted, will be up against their first hostile crowd for their fourth match, against the host country, although the intensity of the support in this part of the world does not necessarily work in the desired direction. 
Win, and the public goes wild; lose, and they go even wilder. 
One of the more memorable sights during England's 1987 World Cup semi-final in Bombay was that of Pandit, having misfielded twice on the mid-wicket boundary, <tag "517325">knee-deep</> in cardboard hats, orange peel and other assorted missiles, and following India's failure in the Sharjah Cup and defeat against the West Indies in Delhi on Monday, the knives are out in a big way. 

800076
Meanwhile Mark Linnett, the loose head who made his England debut against Fiji 12 days ago, has a damaged hamstring. 
He faces a fitness test as does Peter Mitchell, Moseley's other first-team prop, who has strained <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments.   

800077
I shall be in the dug-out giving instructions to my team as usual." 
Ipswich will be without club captain Romeo Zondervann who misses his second game through a <tag "517036">knee</> injury. 

800078
St Helens have refused New Zealand permission to use George Mann, their Auckland prop, for the rest of the tour. 
Mann was wanted as a replacement for James Goulding, who flew home injured at the weekend. 
The Kiwis are also looking for cover for Tea Ropati, their second-team centre, who is to be sent home with <tag "517036">knee</> damage.   

800079
MARK Falco could make a dramatic return from injury in the Queen's Park Rangers line-up to face Liverpool at Anfield tonight in their FA Cup quarter-final replay. 
Don Howe, the QPR coach, is considering fielding the former Spurs and Watford striker, who has not played since undergoing a <tag "517036">knee</> cartilage operation in November.   

800080
It is not a bit of use firmly pronouncing it Loney as First Tuesday (Yorks) does. 
The whole enterprise buckles at the <tag "516619-x">knees</> from that moment as if struck by a flying duck.   

800081
The Lions like the high way but are not rigid disciples of one code, and passes to feet compared favourably with passes measured in feet from the ground. 
The pass master was Gary Waddock, playing only his second First Division game after a two-and-a-half year absence caused by a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800082
Dean carried his warming-up methods to lengths that were not appreciated by his fellow actors of the older school. 
According to Rock Hudson: `He never stepped into camera range without first jumping into the air with his <tag "516619">knees</> up under his chin or running round the set shrieking like a bird of prey."  

800083
These were my younger days, and I had bought a particularly diaphanous pair of stockings for the occasion. 
Both <tag "516629">knees</> were gone inside a minute. 

800086
`And these are my breasts," she said, in a tone of gentle assurance, wisdom, resignation &dash. as if to imply that, yes, she was aware that she was uncoyly allowing our eyes a long, scorchingly frank look at them, allowing us even to see the spotlit lymphatic structures beneath, because once they were presented to us in this saintly, unfurtive way, in our formative years, all misplaced lusts and irresponsible pregnancies and destructive infidelity would disappear from the world. 
The Camp Fire Girls filed out; I hovered, but I was too aware of a museum staff person waiting outside to try to touch TAM's knee. 
And bicycling home I found that already TAM'S <tag "516619">knee</>, her nude immobile physical self, was becoming less interesting than the idea of the real woman who had been paid to do TAM'S voice. 

800087
`We would like to pay tribute to his loyalty, his ability, and his brilliant contribution to Wigan's success." 
St Helens, not entirely unexpectedly, have released Tea Ropati, the New Zealand centre plagued by a knee injury. 
Ropati was invalided out of the Kiwi tour and had his Saints debut delayed by persistent <tag "517036">knee</> trouble.   

800088
`But won't there be difficulties?" 
`I'll say, especially if Wogan tries to put his hand on its <tag "516619">knee</>!" 

800090
Ratcliffe said: `I had words with Wilson about noise too." 
He was sitting in his usual chair, his veined hands on jutting <tag "516668">kneecaps</> clad in lovat tweed.   

800091
`I told you I'd never heard of him." 
Pertwee bit his lip and looked down at his <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800092
Against such a fragile background it was difficult to read much into the various price movements. 
Even so the performance of Connell, the estate agent, suggested something more than a <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> reaction by tired and inexperienced market makers.   

800093
Appropriately Bill had begun his career in Defiance, Ohio. 
He led a band called the Ohio Lucky Seven in the early Twenties and on one occasion in 1924 played opposite Bix Beiderbecke and the Wolverines. 
A photo of the band shows Bill sitting in typical pose, the bell of his cornet on one <tag "516632">knee</> and his hair parted down the middle. 

800094
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, what going on 'ere then? 
Two hofficers of the law enjoying a bit of a <tag "516686">knees</> up? &ellip

Dutch West Indian to be precise. 
Ruud Gullit, the most celebrated rasta since Bob Marley, would like it to be known that reports of his demise have been exaggerated, but after three <tag "517036">knee</> operations he will not play again until March, at the earliest, and serious doubts are being expressed about his participation in the World Cup.   

800096
The 25-year-old rider, who is attached to Nick Gaselee's Upper Lambourn stable, broke two bones in his lower right leg in a fall at Chepstow ten days ago. 
He will be in plaster for five weeks and will then undergo an operation for the removal of a metal bar inserted to strengthen the leg below the knee. 
`Initially, it was very painful, but the <tag "516619">knee</> is now in a hinge device and I am able to get about on crutches," said Adams.   

800097
She liked to read it there; it felt comforting after a row. 
Now she lay on her back with her navy blue knickers still around her <tag "516619">knees</>. 

800098
Was the detective, Henry wondered, stimulating himself in some way? 
He looked down and saw Rush, on his <tag "516631">knees</>, eyes fixed to the crack in the cupboard door.   

800099
Malawian women do not wear shorts or trousers. 
In public, except at the Lake or in National Parks, women tourists are expected to wear <tag "517085">knee-length</> dresses or skirts &dash. and if not, will give great offence.   

800100
`Next week I'll be in America," she said. 
`I'll write to you," he said and she just pressed his <tag "517036">knee</> as she drove through Enfield.

By keeping the shoulder turn at 90 degrees to the spine angle, your body posture will remain constant throughout the swing (Diagram B) 
One of the best exercises you can use to develop this important body turn movement is to place a club behind your neck and hold it in position with your hands. 
Adopt your normal posture by angling forward from the waist and sitting slightly through the <tag "516619">knees</>.

Too late to reach it now for already a squad of SS, rifles at the ready, were running towards the church, attracted by the sound of firing. 
Osbourne turned, ran along the aisle and left from the back door by the sacristy, racing through the gravestones of the cemetery at the rear of the church, vaulting the low stone wall, and started up the hill to the wood above. 
They began shooting when he was half way up and he ran, zigzagging wildly, was almost there when a bullet plucked at his left sleeve sending him sideways to fall on one <tag "516631">knee</>.  

800104

For footballer Andrew Dawson, it's money well spent, as physiotherapy is his only hope rescuing his playing career after a devastating knee injury. 
Andrew, who was about to play top league amateur football with Bicester, was stretchered off with a knee injury playing for Old Woodstock just under a year ago. 
The 20-year-old midfielder hasn't played since, as a cartilage operation did not prevent his tearing a ligament in the same <tag "516619">knee</> just before Christmas.

They sat on one another's <tag "516632">knees</> and joked.

Thompson, in an interview on BBC Television's Sportsnight programme, says he is neither pessimistic nor optimistic about his prospects for the Games but is convinced he can still be an athletics force for the next four or five years. 
He said last night: `I've had a spot of bother for the past four or five years with my <tag "516619">knee</> so I had these X-rays done and they found a bone growth about the size of a pea. 

800112
`Evaporated milk!" I whispered. 
`Delicious evaporated milk!" I was risking wasting all those moaned stanzas of `Over Hill, Over Dale" by introducing my voice into her doze curve, but I needed a last instant of alertness from her, an acknowledgment by eye contact before she went more completely to sleep that I was the kindly person who held her with her <tag "516619">knees</> slightly bent the way she liked, and who made my sweater fully available to her hand, and who, today, had gotten the rocker to bump with unusual indolence: the proud sponsor of her nap.   

800113
On either side of this were two men, all four dressed in those brown robes with the pointed hoods that Spanish clerics wear and from which the Ku-Klux-Klan took their inspiration. 
These hooded men stood with their faces obscured while people queued to kiss Christ on the <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800114
Collins lost his enthusiasm remarkably quickly. 
Harding had shocked Collins with an early salvo of punches, one of which put the challenger on his <tag "516631">knees</> for an eight count after only two minutes. 

800115
Axton thought he had scored a second goal late in the game, but the umpire ruled it out.

He put her on the passenger seat, laying her flat with her head on his lap so as not to mark the seat with blood. 
Probably he had a newspaper or an old rug to cover his <tag "516619">knees</>, something he could burn when he got home.   

800117
A seagull flew overhead, followed by another. 
They'd returned knowing danger was past Slowly she sank onto her <tag "516631">knees</>, and tumbled forwards.

Actually, it is doubtful whether there are many people, however decent, with whom the diminutive Sports Minister could stand shoulder-to-shoulder. 
<tag "516668">Shoulder-to-kneecap</>, maybe.   

800121
Brown canvas laced leggings and black leather shoes completed the outfit. 
The equivalent uniform for officers was described in the 1985 Regulations as: ` &ellip. a single-breasted sack coat of dark-blue cloth or serge, with standing collar fastened &ellip

These young brokers come up here telling me what I'm doing wrong in my business while their own industry is on its <tag "516633">knees</>."   

800123
Why?" 
`Well, you know, I thought &dash." De&acute.sire&acute.e shook her curiously coiffured head and moved her arm another half-circumference round the one of his she already had hold of, at the same time really quite worryingly trying to push her other hand between his thighs several inches above the <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800124
Alison was wearing a dark green shift, rather short. 
Franca surveyed her long athletic bare legs and the smudge of the scar on her <tag "516619">knee</> as she reached up to the high shelf of a cupboard.   

800125
Then this woman said: `You marry yourself." 
I thought for a moment that this was a deeply philosophical statement on my solitary status, but she said it again tapping my <tag "516619">knee</> &dash. it was by way of being an order.   

800126
A move down the left 20 minutes from time gave Michael Conroy space and he was about to cross when he was brought down in the area by Ian Alexander. 
Stuart Beavon took the penalty, the first Reading shot on target, but it was hit towards the centre of the goal and the ball bounced off the <tag "516619">knees</> of Rovers' on-loan goalkeeper, Brian Parkin.   

800127
The experience was made all the more painful by his father's sobbing on the quayside in Ireland as he bade the boys farewell, and by the boys' not having the ability to express whatever it was they felt. 
Forty years later, Jacks said he had felt merely `embarrassed and self-conscious", and hated the discomfort of his school uniform &dash. an Eton collar, a black coat, knickerbockers which buttoned at the <tag "516629">knee</>.   

800128

Every cindery boulder making up the jumbled chaotic surface is loose,  irregularly angular in shape, and covered in razor-sharp protrusions. 
Every step is a balancing act; every slip of the foot means a series of  razor-like slashes on one's boots; to fall means badly lacerated hands  and <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800131
As a boy he was left-handed, but forced to become right-handed. 
He was made to wear splints to cure his bandy <tag "516619">knees</>.

One man, they told me, is a `weeper". 
He sits with his <tag "516619">knees</> drawn up, his hand out, and cries continuously.   

800133
Deepening purple. 
Smoky voice coming up the stair. 
A child calling out, on his hands and <tag "516627">knees</>.   

800134
How would you harass a male pupil? 
Well, if I {vocal sound="um"} said to one of my students something about that was a very good essay you wrote, in fact I'd like to discuss it a little bit more down at the pub and down at the pub I put my hand on his <tag "516619">knee</> perhaps in making a point about how good his essay was.   

800135
Marcus was still in the lavatory. 
Ludens went to look at Irina who was on her <tag "516631">knees</> rummaging in a pile of clothes which now covered the floor of the bedroom.

`I know madness when I see it," said Alida Thorne firmly, `and I saw it in Isabel Lavender." 
Dorothea was beside herself with agitation, but sitting on a telephone chair in the hall, with Hastings the cat cramped on her <tag "516632">knees</>, she could not think clearly what to say or do.   

800139
You won't be surprised to learn that they won by ten wickets. 
Aston Villa could be just a day away from their first trophy of a new season, they play Arsenal tonight at Wembley in the fourteen <guess>Maceeter</guess> tournament with the prospect of a final tomorrow against <guess>Samdoria</guess> or <guess>Rael Sociadad</guess> live on television. 
David Platt's return from world cup stage to Wembley stage is likely to be spoilt by a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.  

800140
And you," he turned to Edge, `try anything like that again and I'll personally see you court-martialled." 
They went out, totally leaving Edge on his hands and <tag "516627">knees</>, gasping for breath, and walked back towards Cold Harbour.   

800141
Reginald and Henry were having a game of billiards. 
But Charles and Elaine were sitting on the rug before the open wood fire in the drawing room. 
They were sitting as they had done as children years ago, Elaine with her legs tucked under her, Charles with his arms round his <tag "516619">knees</>.

Hodge, who injured a hamstring training with England, is fit to return for Forest.

800143
Alastair Brian Walden does not like that kind of thing. 
Under the headline `The harsh vulgarity of modern Toryism", he wrote in The Times that `this is a <tag "516619-m">knee-in-the-groin</> Government, with no damned chivalry about it".   

800144
Many of the phantoms are amputees, both adults and children, and without artificial limbs. 
At the Rehabilitation Centre, Dr To Anh Nah, said: `Seldom a day passes when people in the countryside do not step on an old American mine that blows legs off beneath the <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800145
In Scotland, where Conservatives are regarded as an alien or feudal force, a professional Labour politician, these last 10 years, could more easily regard the Labour Party as the natural party of government and conclude that what was most wrong with it south of the border was the English. 
Mr Smith has none of the revisionist convert's zeal, no hang-ups about what he learnt at Aneurin Bevan's <tag "516706-x">knee</>, and no great difficulty in combining pragmatic politics with moral conviction.   

800146
Male mourners only. 
For funerals, the Reverend Bottingley  felt, were not a woman's occasion, they were too hard on the emotions, and on the feet and <tag "516619">knees</>, and he did not like to see women weep in public.   

800147
It contains papain, an enzyme which removes protein from the skin's surface leaving it revitalised. 
Apply to rough areas on arms and <tag "516619">knees</>, and leave on for up to ten minutes.

Other than the absence of David Gower and Robin Smith, compelling reasons for Hampshire's pedestrian struggle were difficult to find. 
On an easy-paced wicket on which the ball could get no higher than the waist and no lower than the <tag "516619">knee</>, and against a bowling attack which read Tim Munton, Joey Benjamin, Adrian Pierson and Dermot Reeve, this was not the stuff of batsmen's nightmares.  

800149
But to four generations of admirers in this country he is plainly, irrepressibly, Just William. 
With his concertinaed socks, scuffed shoes, battered cap and filthy <tag "516619">knees</>, he was the apotheosis of glorious, dirty little boydom.   

800150
With press-ups you lie on your  stomach on the floor and, keeping your back straight, you  push your body upwards so that your arms are straight and  your body is supported on your toes and hands. 
For stomach  curls you lie on your back on the floor, bend your <tag "516619">knees</>  upwards slightly (while keeping your feet on the floor), then  lift your head and shoulders a few inches off the floor (do not  use your hands or arms to support your weight).

800154
PORTSMOUTH today signed Tottenham defender Gary Stevens for a #250,000 fee in the first major transfer deal on deadline day. 
Former England defender Stevens, who is in the third month of a loan spell with the Second Division club, joined Spurs from Brighton in June 1983, but his career at White Hart Lane was dogged by injury, with an operation on a snapped <tag "517036">knee</> ligament in 1988 keeping him out for several months. 

800155
Somerset batted for 102 overs after taking the last two Surrey wickets, scraping a second batting point in the last half-hour.

After their all-rounder Rodney Ontong announced his retirement following a serious <tag "517036">knee</> injury, they made the short journey across the Severn Bridge and were bowled out for 89 by Gloucestershire at Bristol, writes Ian Malin.   

800159
These were my younger days, and I had bought a particularly diaphanous pair of stockings for the occasion. 
Both knees were gone inside a minute. 
It is disconcerting to sit on a hard chair trying to maintain eye-contact with two complete strangers when there are circles of white leg where your black <tag "516629">knees</> should be.   

800160
The selectors have opted instead for Phil Burrows of Hulme GS, who played only one half, but has established a reputation for reliability. 
ZARAK KHAN, the world's ninth-ranked squash player, will be out of the game for at least six months after tearing ligaments in his <tag "516619">knee</> during his match with the England captain, Bryan Beeson, in the Stuttgart Open on Monday.   

800161
Tottenham will be searching for inspiration against Manchester United at Old Trafford without their usual source, Paul Gascoigne, who has failed to pass a fitness test on an ankle injury sustained in the 3-0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday. 
Spurs will also be without their suspended strikers Paul Stewart and Paul Walsh, but they are able to recall Gascoigne's midfield partner, Nayim, who has recovered after missing two games with a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800162
People would have lived happily if it wasn't for the troubles instigated by the government and the Jewish Agency." 
It was only when he came to 1936 that Damiani's face grew suddenly cold and his hands, until now resting quietly on his <tag "516619">knees</>, began to move in agitation.   

800163
While headroom in the back rates as adequate, legroom is at a premium. 
The long-legged must either sit with their <tag "516619">knees</> at the same altitude as their ears, or ask those in the front to relinquish some of their territory. 

800165
`That's hardly an answer." 
`Nothing can be false or faked," insisted Bourne, leaning forward in the armchair, his elbows on his bare <tag "516619">knees</>, his hands clasped.   

800167
Previously, he had played only on the wing or at centre for the club. 
Brian Moore, the England hooker who missed the defeat against London when the Divisional Championship opened last weekend, has recovered from a <tag "517036">knee</> injury and will be in the Midlands front row for their second match &dash. against the North at Moseley on Saturday.   

800168
Many years later, when the man with the tic from MI5 asked for a photograph, it was all we could come up with. 
I began to fill out above my grey, gartered stockings, my <tag "516619">knees</> scarred from the broken glass on Agatha Jennings's window sill, and to rove out into the wide world. 

800169
It combines earth tones with gloss and natural movement.

In the main individual role, Jeffery Kissoon as Odewale acquires enormous, bull-necked, restless power. 
His final entrance, on hands and <tag "516627">knees</>, his blood a huge crimson train of cloth reaching back from his head, is a brilliant coup of acting, design and direction.   

800171
An inebriated local made an amourous grab for the 16-year-old in our party as she pushed her way through those high-kicking to Cliff Richard's `Mistletoe and Wine". 
The embrace sent him weak at the <tag "516709">knees</>, but perhaps not as he might have hoped: her short-arm tackle to the chin would have silenced Cardiff Arms Park.   

800172
The most expensive seats will cost #20, the cheapest #5. 
Gary Walsh, the Manchester United goalkeeper who has not played League football since November 1987 because of <tag "517036">knee</> and ankle injuries, is due to appear in an A team fixture for United on Saturday. 

800173
THOMAS MUSTER continued his fightback from injury when he overpowered New Zealand's Kelly Evernden 6-3, 6-2 during his country's 3-0 first round victory in the Hopman Cup team tennis tournament yesterday in Perth. 
The Austrian's career was almost ruined in April when his car was struck head- on in Miami as he removed his kit from the boot. 
He received torn <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments and spent much of the year with his left knee in plaster.   

800174
BORIS BECKER, the Wimbledon and US Open champion, enjoyed an encouraging return to Grand Prix play yesterday when he beat Milan Srejber in the first round of the Paris Open. 
Fluid on the <tag "516619">knee</> and a visit to his girlfriend's grandparents in East Germany have restricted him to just two exhibition matches since his triumph at Flushing Meadow.

`Cloakroom", where the `best place in hide and seek is hanging crucified / across two pegs with <tag "516619">knees</> drawn up / beneath a duffle coat" , should go straight into the anthologies, but several of the poems suffer from their good intentions and seem to have conspicuously palpable designs upon their young readers.   

800177
Nothing's happened, nothing like that." 
`Oh, so you think it's a perfectly ordinary way of going on, do you," said her companion, a sharp-featured little man of about twenty-five with restless eyes, `to invite a perfect stranger you've known it can't be more than twenty minutes into your bed?" They were lying in it at the time, or rather Fiona was lying on her side with her face towards the wall and the fellow, whose name she never learnt or inquired, sat in what could not have been a very comfortable position with his <tag "516619">knees</> drawn up.

`What they need is a clock with a bomb attached to it, not a radio," says Vic, patting his pockets, checking for wallet, diary, keyring, calculator, cigarettes and lighter. 
Marjorie helps him on with his camelhair overcoat, a garment she persuaded him to buy against his better judgement, for it hangs well below his <tag "516619">knees</> and, he thinks, accentuates his short stature, as well as making him look like a prosperous bookie.   

800181
She immediately received a reply to say that he would come. 
It was a morning early in August that trembling at the <tag "516619">knees</> Michael had gone down to the station to meet Nick Fawley.

For the rest of the 1950s he regularly made the British team; he was eighth in the 1955 world championship four-man bobsleigh event and tenth in the two-man bob race at the Olympic Games at Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956. 
He cut a striking figure, often competing in a long black astrakhan overcoat, its tails tucked between his <tag "516619">knees</> and steering wheel.   

800185
It was that sort of night. 
Ruud Gullit, sidelined through injury since June, is to have a second <tag "517036">knee</> operation tomorrow, which may keep the Milan striker out of action until well into the new year. 

800186
Ludens, amazed at his own emotion, found he was kneeling on one knee. 
He stood up and shook himself, like a dog emerging He dragged at his shirt and ruffled his hair and stamped his feet an swung his arms about. 
Marcus, who had resumed his composed posture, his hands clasped on his <tag "516632">knee</>, watched this performance with lifted eyebrows. 

800187
It was quite amazing. 
David was a character known as Cloud I think. 
I dressed him in this huge pink shirt with maroon spots on, with a big maroon and pink ruff and {typo bad="litle",good="little"} <tag "516670">knee</> britches in grey with red velvet stripes on them.

Sir: 
As a Jew, I write to dissociate myself from the demands of my `representatives", the Board of Deputies, that the BBC should have banned the broadcast of Desert Island Discs in which Lady Mosley was interviewed (front page, 27 November). 
For an official Jewish organisation to propose a ban on any free expression of opinion is bad enough; to attempt to muzzle the tired ramblings of an old, self-deluded lady approaches the category of <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> reaction. 

800189
Wink made up his mind to flatter me into loving him. 
He would gaze at me with an expression of adoration, then jump on to my <tag "516632">knee</> and kiss me ardently.

Pain and nausea swept over him in waves that left him hot and sticky and weak at the <tag "516709">knees</>. 

800193
Decisions on the other two midfield positions may have to be delayed. 
Erwin Koeman is struggling for fitness after a <tag "517036">knee</> operation, while Jan Wouters and Gerald Vanenburg have ankle strains.   

800194
There is, though, nothing unusual in that. 
Twickenham, which has been an inspirational setting for recent University matches, also has the capacity to turn its participants weak at the <tag "516709">knees</>.

I can't remember who he was supporting, but I was a regular visitor because being a big blues fan, it meant I could go and see Sonny Boy Williamson, and all the people who would be at the Richmond Jazz/American Blues Folk Festival that came every year. 
So I was down there watching The Yardbirds and the English bands that were starting, and one time there was this band &dash. for some reason I was there early and watching the sound check &dash. with this blond guy who had very long blond hair, and <tag "517085">knee-length</> sort of sued, fringed, Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood-looking boots, playing a bit of sax on stage. 

800197
Quite frequently." 
Billykins gave a juddering sob and started to bang her head against her <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800198
Yet she felt that she had had a revelation. 
She looked at the radiant, sombre, tender, powerful canvas of Gainsborough and felt a sudden desire to go down on her <tag "516631">knees</> before it, embracing it, shedding tears.   

800199
At that moment they came round a corner and Rene&acute. had to swerve violently to avoid an old woman leading a cow along the road on a halter. 
Genevieve was thrown into the corner, Reichslinger with her and she became aware that his hand was on her knee. 
`Are you all right, Mamselle?" His voice was hoarse, the grip on her <tag "516619">knee</> tightened. 

800200
Griffiths, after a two-month absence, played the final quarter on Sunday and is expected to replace the injured Neil Holding. 
Frodsham is fit after damaging <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments three weeks ago at Hull. 

800201
Vic went to see his Personnel Director about it. 
George Prendergast was sitting crosslegged on the floor in the middle of his office, with his hands on his <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800202
Those who have a cold or flu are doubting whether they have had enough time to get over the illness, even if it did strike last November. 
And those who felt a niggle in their <tag "516619">knee</> last month are wondering whether it will get better in April 21.   

800203
PETER Rhoades-Brown has been granted a testimonial by Oxford United &dash. and he may try to bring together again the 1986 Milk Cup winning team. 
Rosie, a great favourite with the fans, was forced to quit the game this week when it became clear he was unlikely to recover sufficiently from a bad <tag "517036">knee</> injury to play at competitive first team level.   

800204
I could have ended up a cripple, unable to walk properly, and it just wasn't worth it." 
`I would be kidding myself if I pretended the <tag "516619">knee</> would ever get back to the way it was."   

800205
`Craig's certainly more direct and more confident these days", he said. 
Stuart Henderson, the Melrose secretary, feels the youngster &dash. he celebrated his 21st birthday last week &dash. has maybe had a bit more responsibility thrust on him by the <tag "517036">knee</> injury which has prevented Keith Robertson, capped 44 times, lining up alongside him.   

800206
But these stories were not history, nor were they canonized in any definitive collection of `Greek myths". 
Their oral transmission `at mother's <tag "516706-x">knee</>" was no doubt subject to the huge variations which characterize nearly all such oral traditions, variations of emphasis and the mood no less than of narrative content (whatever `deep structures" the reductionist sage may claim to detect). 

800207
Simon, 17, who also suffers from epilepsy, was left for dead after an attacker plunged a needle into his spine. 
When Oxford doctor Alison Redmayne discovered him, he was crawling around his hut with sores on his <tag "516619">knees</> and ankles.   

800209
Locals told me that they are disappearing at the rate of nine a day. 
Poachers will shoot a group of 10 elephants to get one pair of tusks; they usually hit the animals in the <tag "516619">knees</> to down them and leave them to die slowly.  

800210
DeFreitas replaces first Test hero Devon Malcolm, while England make one other change from the side which shocked the cricket world in Kingston earlier this week &dash. spinner Eddie Hemmings coming in for batsman Nasser Hussain. 
In fact, the team is identical to that originally picked for the rain-ruined opening one-day international at Port of Spain, Trinidad. 
On that occasion, DeFreitas pulled out just before start of play with a twisted <tag "516619">knee</> to be replaced by Chris Lewis. 

800212
That is just about acceptable. 
He can swap reindeer for trains, especially the steam variety. 
But he should try to be seated on all occasions, so children can climb on to his <tag "516632">knee</> and whisper into his ear.   

800213
Spurs restore Gascoigne after injury, and Stewart, having served his suspension, may return. 
A <tag "517036">knee</> injury rules out Nayim.   

800214
I put her down on the couch and said, `Just put your head back," and told her some Alexander Principles. 
I put her on the floor with a book behind her head &dash. Bonfire of the Vanities &dash. and said, right up with your <tag "516619">knees</> (to give her some simple breathing exercises)."  

800215
Debbie was present in our bedroom until five minutes before Debbie was born and then again about an hour later &dash. absence was her choice as it was her teatime and her tea was ready!! 
When I was feeding Debbie, Debbie used to sit on my <tag "516632">knee</> too and we would read books around him.   

800216
`How about you, Michael?" said Nick. 
`It would be rather a squeeze, but I expect someone could sit on someone's <tag "516632">knee</>." 

800217
Rehn and Pointon are added to last week's 13. 
Manchester Utd v Tottenham Mimms, kept out of the Spurs goal since 2 January by Thorstvedt, Tottenham's Player of the Year, replaces the Norwegian, who has <tag "517036">knee</> ligament damage.  

800218
Plymouth v Stoke Plymouth are unchanged &dash. despite the 6-1 home defeat by Arsenal in midweek. 
Stoke, still searching for a League win, recall #250,000 front-man Biggins, fit after <tag "517036">knee</> surgery. 

800219
The bundle she had disturbed eddied a few inches into the deeper water and as Wexford watched, a thin pale hand, lifeless as the agate-veined stones, rose slowly from the sodden cloth, its fingers hanging yet pointing towards him. 
He took off his shoes and socks and rolled his trousers to his <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800220
And as the dreary years go by, Sciatica `neath an attic sky. 
IN THE eighteenth century, the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus fell to his <tag "516631">knees</> on beholding the scene to the west of Shooters Hill, Greenwich, `wrapped in a golden fleece of blossoms".   

800221
Frankie got to his feet with difficulty. 
He felt sick. 
His <tag "516619">knees</> were wobbling as if they might collapse under the strain of holding his body upright.   

800222
Left leads to the Yiossos Apostolidhis hut on the Plateau of the Muses, a necessary staging-point if you are going to complete the best round-trip on the mountain. 
The setting is dramatic, 2,600 metres up at the base of the bristling Stefani peak, the so-called Throne of Zeus, where the Thunderer himself sits in state, and where you might also catch a glimpse of one of Greece's few remaining herds of mountain goats. 
The next day you complete the circuit with a five-hour, <tag "516619">knee-jarring</> but beautiful descent back to the Litokhoro road, just short of your starting-point at Prionia.   

800223
`Then-write-down-the-sodding-greenish-hills!" she snarled, jabbing me with her crochet needle. 
I remember I lay on my back, my <tag "516619">knees</> pale in the light from the window, looking up my grandmother's nose. 

800225
At that moment there was a knock on the door and Marion Russell blundered breathlessly into the room. 
She stopped on the threshold and stared at Vic on his <tag "516631">knees</>.   

800226
The son learned his football in a shared backyard or on `patches of grit and oily grass, hemmed in by the crouched streets, with the rusty swings and roundabouts, which creaked under a cafuffle of ragged children. 
Jackets made goal-posts, and: `If you went down you got up with a lump of a cinder in your <tag "516619">knee</>."   

800227
Christy's words came back when Sandy was putts for birdie on the 12th and 13th but misses them both. 
At the 14th he hits into the left-hand rough. 
It's <tag "516678">knee-deep</> and reedy.   

800228
The West Ham manager, Lou Macari, who is looking for more height and power up front, will decide in a month's time whether to offer a long-term contract to Justin Fashanu. 
The forward once valued at #1m recently returned from the United States after missing three years with a <tag "517036">knee</> injury. 

800229
Worcestershire captain Phil Neale admits he is worried that Dilley could break down and leave his side carrying a man in the field &dash. or worse still, reduced to ten men. 
Neale says: `Dilley played in our championship win over Gloucestershire earlier this week, but he is still having problems with his knee and he may not be able to bowl a second spell." 
`The opposition will know he has a long-term <tag "517036">knee</> problem and if he hurts it again, I'm not sure they will let us use a substitute fielder."  

800230
`I was and have always been his dog. 
When he is sad because the world rejects him I shall place my paw upon his <tag "516619">knee</>, and he will be moved and heartened and his strength will be renewed.   

800231
Meanwhile, the recipient in an alleged head-kicking incident at Twickenham last Saturday, plays on. 
Richard Langhorn, the No. 8 whose stitches resulted in a letter of complaint to Swansea by Harlequins, has been passed fit to play for Quins in this weekend's First Division game at Bedford. 
Another Harlequin, Everton Davis, has been seeking a second opinion on the <tag "517036">knee</> injury that forced him out of last month's England training session.   

800232
The addition of the 22-year-old Clement to the squad offers the selectors extra options: the Swansea man has experience at fly-half, wing and full-back. 
He was called up last week as a replacement for the England wing, Chris Oti, whose injured right <tag "517036">knee</> ligament forced him out of the tour.   

800233
Schmidt appeared from nowhere, darted around him and got the back door open. 
Hare simply threw Edge through it and the pilot fell to one <tag "516631">knee</>.   

800234
He looked back out into the room and, to his horror, saw that Mrs Sprott was starting to undress. 
She slipped her dress over her shoulders and allowed it to fall to her <tag "516619">knees</>.   

800235
Dressed in beard and pigtails, black Armani suit and spanking new blue jogging shoes, Pete looked mean, lean and young by book editing standards. 
His tinnitus did not, as we had been led to believe, oblige him to spend the concert inside a perspex box; he leapt across the stage, <tag "516619">knees</> at 90-degree angles, for much of its three hour span. 

800236
This came about because the Japanese bombed the American naval base at pearl Harbour. 
(In Honolulu, where they wear grass skirts and play guitars flat across their <tag "516632">knees</>.)   

800237
Number 47 looked as if he were in a conversational mood. 
As Henry got through the front gate, number 60 went back up the street towards his wife and number 47 dropped, suddenly and dramatically, on to his <tag "516631">knees</> in front of the red Mitsubishi.   

800239
Liverpool v Spurs Neither manager is prepared to give any clues as to his line-up for tomorrow's televised match. 
Tottenham, in good heart after their Littlewoods Cup win at Manchester United, hope to have Gascoigne (ankle) and Walsh (<tag "516619">knee</>) fit, but must find a replacement in defence for Fenwick, who broke a leg at Old Trafford.   

800240
Whenever he stood at the turn of the great stairs, with the entrance-hall and main door at his back, he knew he was facing the very worst the house could offer. 
To his left the row of coats like so many black and patient predators; to his right the secret horrors trapped beyond the cellar door; and between them, at the very end of the unlit corridor, Sweetheart's daytime room, the kitchen. 
Frankie shifted his position so that his <tag "516619">knees</> would not become cramped.   

800241
Shock is an odd phenomenon. 
The first thing Mick wanted was a drink, so he jumped up on the tractor to get one &dash. that his left leg, severed at the <tag "516619">knee</>, was still wrapped around the drive shaft seemed unimportant. 

800242
The hand resisted, then after a moment gave way. 
Ludens held her moist hot hand between his thin dry cool hands, nursing it upon his knee as if it were a wounded bird. 
He lifted it, as if he were about to kiss it, laid it for an instant against his cheek, then restored it, still captive, to his <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800243
Round the corner." 
My <tag "516619">knees</> are sagging.   

800244
It was an invitation to take her own out because, after all, she was a busy woman too. 
His touch on her <tag "516619">knee</> was like a little electric shock, but pleasant.   

800245
Thompson, in an interview on BBC Television's Sportsnight programme, says he is neither pessimistic nor optimistic about his prospects for the Games but is convinced he can still be an athletics force for the next four or five years. 
He said last night: `I've had a spot of bother for the past four or five years with my knee so I had these X-rays done and they found a bone growth about the size of a pea. 
`They also found that my <tag "516668">kneecap</> was not quite straight so they moved it over. 

800246
He was  wearing a zip-up black bomber jacket and dark blue denim jeans. 
The other man is young with dark hair in a six-inch pony tail, dressed in a <tag "517085">knee-length</> beige or fawn heavyweight coat and seen in central Oxford over a  four-hour period before the murder.   

800247
She appeared slenderer in face than in her photograph, and her long curly golden hair was even more resplendent. 
The scarlet of her lipstick was matched by a red velvet dress, the neckline scooped to show off an exquisite throat, and the <tag "517085">knee-length</> skirt generously cut. 

800248
Question Two: 
And who is now the Prime Minister's political secretary, at the very time that her Government is having its <tag "516619-x">knees</> caned by Sir Leon over the Rover Group sale, sweeteners and so on?   

800249
This proved to be a mistake. 
To her dismay he seized her hand, and dropped to his <tag "516631">knees</> beside her chair, in a posture reminiscent of one of the engravings in her old Tennyson Poems.   

800250
The second man is described as white, about 45 years old, of medium build. 
He was wearing a beige cap and beige coloured <tag "517085">knee</> length coat.   

800251
`If that doesn't give the Welsh boys hope, I don't know what will," Phillips said. 
And by way of reinforcement, New Zealand's injury problems were exacerbated by the premature departure of Va'aiga Tuigamala with a sprained ankle and Paul Henderson, whose <tag "517036">knee</> injury may be ligament damage, which would end his tour.   

800252
We had paid some money to the police to look after us and they were also taking money from the journalists, and giving us their news, and ours to them! 
But this young one, a very spiritual guy, like a leftover from The Deer Hunter with a black headband and black jersey, said he wanted to shoo these journalists; he had a revolver with him all the time, he is licensed to kill and he says he'd shoot them if they came near , and I said `No, please don't do that, I'll get in more trouble," and he said, `I'll just hit them in the <tag "516619">knee</>." 

800253
His leg was put in plaster for six weeks and although he is now out of plaster there is still a lengthy recuperation period before he can begin to jog or cycle to build up the muscles again. 
Said Oxford United physio John Clinkard: `Normally it would take 12-18 months to recover from such a complete crack, but it's a stable fracture and it is showing good signs of healing." 
Steve McClaren and Martin Foyle last night saw the specialist who has been overseeing their recoveries from injuries last season and Richard Hill, now fit again after a bad <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments injury last summer, will see the same specialist on Monday.   

800255
Relatively clean living and the spartan regime of Traggets &dash. and the fact that I had never set foot inside a public house &dash. meant that I was at the time a first-class specimen of English boyhood. 
I was, and I say this in no boastful fashion, expert at single stick and the lightweight pike; being able to steer a bicycle with my <tag "516619">knees</>, while firing a catapult or whirling a gaucho's bolas.   

800256
They inherited from Byzantium the mantle of Constantine the Great, the first Roman emperor to accept Christianity, and who largely ruled the Church of his time. 
Western Christians have been less willing to give absolute obedience to the secular authorities, and perhaps a certain readiness to bow the <tag "516655">knee</> to the state-assisted Bolsheviks to overthrow Russian Christianity during the early years of their accession to power, following the revolution of 1917.   

800257
`The Empire too, we can depend on you &ellip. !" 
And so we sang, making one circuit of the room then marching down the hall. 
My mother slid the bolt on the door of the downstairs lavatory, but we caught De Kuyper in the kitchen and stood together, my <tag "516619">knees</> still rising and falling, De Kuyper's contralto soaring above our bass and treble as we came to the last line &ellip   

800258
Not with anyone. 
An image of his daughter in the act of love, her white <tag "516619">knees</> parted, a dark shape above her, flashes unbidden into his head and  fills him with rage and disgust.   

800259
MAN UTD v SHEFF WED Ince has recovered from a groin strain and United are unchanged for Ron Atkinson's return to Old Trafford. 
Wednesday will be unchanged after their 8-0 drubbing of Aldershot in the Littlewoods Cup &dash. provided Palmer shakes off a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800260
He's feeling the pressure." 
We've been a bit lucky because, although our ball is in high rough &dash. and I mean high; it was up to Greg's <tag "516619">knees</> &dash. we've caught a good lie, so he can hit a pitching-wedge back on to the fairway.   

800261
So h'I says: `Brudder president and brudders, h'I've seen 'ow dis meetin's been conducted up to de present. 
First de white men comes in, and sits down on de right 'and side of de h'aisle, and pulls out deir shooters and deir six-guns and lays dem on deir <tag "516632">knees</>. 

800262
This is no hardship when there are fine fruits on offer instead: compotes of dried fruits as well as fresh apples, pears, bananas, citrus fruits and the first invigorating taste of early forced rhubarb. 
And it means that when we cook and eat puddings we can do so wholeheartedly. 
The Victorians tried to spoil the pleasures of puddings with foolish economies and in so doing brought Britain's once fine reputation to its culinary <tag "516630">knees</>.   

800263
Ann finished a very creditable fourth in the 56 kilo class but the real achievement was her behind-the-scenes battle to compete. 
Last September the Bicester lifter suffered an injured <tag "516619">knee</> and eventually went to Oxford United physiotherapist John Clinkard for treatment. 

800264
Rather, questions must be asked about the difficulties in using the drug, its mandatory medicalized supervision, the persistent and severe bleeding and pain that many women experience, the continuing risk of incomplete pregnancies after administration, and the potential for teratogenic effects (malformation causing) in children born after failed chemical abortions. 
All these questions have been muted by the <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> response from some proponents of the drug that any woman who raises objectons, or even concerns about RU 486, is playing into the hands of the right-wing.   

800265
What are you talking about?" he says. 
`To be brought out into a yard and put in a pony and trap and dumped on relations?" She knows that were she to really feel for him she would enquire about the trap, the cushion he sat on, if there was a rug for his <tag "516632">knees</>, what kind of coat he wore, and the colour of his hair then; but she does not ask these things.   

800266
The speculum is a metal or plastic device, which keeps the walls of the vagina (which are normally in close apposition) apart so that the cervix can be seen and samples can be taken accurately. 
To facilitate this examination, the woman lies on her back with her legs raised towards her chin and the <tag "516619">knees</> or ankles supported.   

800267
It was also during this period that he began to disclose to Arthur some of his more bizarre sexual preferences and fantasies. 
In January 1917, his hand wobbles and he apologizes for his poor handwriting, poor because `it is being done across my <tag "516632">knee</>". 

800268
Only when some worthy institution takes it upon itself to carry out a large-scale survey among skiers will we have real safety evidence on which to base a rational purchase of bindings. 
Until then, we can take comfort from the fact that, when properly adjusted and used in conjunction with modern boots, all modern bindings do a good job of protecting the lower leg. 
Injuries to the <tag "516619">knees</>, the body, the arms and the head are now more common. 

800269
This was cold comfort for the Welsh coach, John Ryan, who by a neat irony was at Twickenham (watching Harlequins v Swansea). 
Ieuan Evans's shoulder let him down on his comeback, possibly ruling the Lions wing out for this season, and Neath's lock prospect Gareth Llewelyn also limped out of contention for a Test place with a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800270
One major obstacle to their progress is certain to miss the match. 
The Aberdeen captain Willie Miller suffered a worrying <tag "517036">knee</> injury playing for Scotland in Wednesday's World Cup match and is out for some time. 

800271
I wish I had some food. 
I sit in one of the armchairs and jig my <tag "516619">knee</> up and down for a bit.   

800272
A SECOND serious injury within a month has hit Derby County only days before the hectic holiday programme. 
Their midfield player, Gary Micklewhite, will be out well into the new year after an operation to repair damaged ligaments in his right knee. 
Ted McMinn is already a long-term casualty, after injuring his left <tag "516619">knee</> at Tottenham last month.  

800273
Oh well that's not bad, so the jogging has served a double purpose so far, or I shouldn't call it jogging really, it's training isn't it? 
Well yes, training, I mean it's more of a jog, I've had a little injury problem with a <tag "516619">knee</>, but {vocal sound="um"} like I say {vocal sound="um"}, it really is a challenge and I'm not going to let anything get in my way.   

800274
Striker Sheringham is doubtful (leg injury) but Hurlock returns from suspension. 
Villa are unchanged, though defender Gage, out for six weeks (achilles tendon), may make the bench. 
Norwich City v Derby County Norwich, unbeaten at home since April, are unchanged, which means the reserve team for Fleck &dash. just recovered from a <tag "517036">knee</> operation &dash. and transfer-listed Allen, who has scored hat-tricks in his last two Combination matches. 

800275
The danger of the play is that it might seem like an RSC in-joke: we even get a vignette outside the Stratford theatre where Joe feigns Englishness to avoid the attentions of a buttonholing American culture-vulture. 
But although Mr Nelson aims some deft blows at <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> Anglophilia, he is really writing about something much bigger.   

800276
Clough and Rice return for a full-strength Forest in place of Gaynor and Carr. 
Chelsea v Wimbledon Nicholas, Chelsea's captain, has a late test on a twisted <tag "516619">knee</>.   

800277
Hansen, Hysen, Barnes and Nicol are all under treatment for Liverpool, while Venison is unlikely to play after being concussed in midweek. 
Millwall v Southampton Briley could return in Millwall's midfield after his <tag "517036">knee</> injury in place of the suspended Hurlock.   

800278
`I knew he was a raging fanatic, so I found a greatcoat that was too small with a button missing, the worst ties I could find, a green shirt and a pair of suede shoes stained with Copydex. 
Then I started to limp slightly and I looked in the mirror and thought who is this? 
It was my father, who had an arthritic <tag "516619">knee</> and used to burst out of his coat, because he was a man on fire.   

800279
His arms went round her and he squashed her to him, his mouth falling greedily on hers. 
She writhed in his grip, refusing to open her mouth to his probing tongue. 
She brought her <tag "516619">knee</> up forcefully but, realizing her intention, he swivelled his crotch out of the way so that her knee merely thumped into his leg. 

800280
In fact, to my eyes, the appearance of informality had been taken to a faintly ludicrous degree. 
It was odd enough to see that rather feminine room crammed full with so many stern, dark-jacketed gentlemen, sometimes sitting three or four abreast upon a sofa; but such was the determination on the part of some persons to maintain the appearance that this was nothing more than a social event that they had actually gone to the lengths of having journals and newspapers open on their <tag "516632">knees</>.   

800281
`That should put him off." 
Robyn laughed, a little selfconsciously, and pressed her <tag "516619">knees</> more closely together.   

800282
Everton have agreed to field their first team in a testimonial match against Hereford United for Mel Pejic, who completes 10 years service for the club this season, on 29 November. 
Glenn Hoddle will be out of action for Monaco for two months after his <tag "516619">knee</> became infected following a cartilage operation.  

800283
At that moment they came round a corner and Rene&acute. had to swerve violently to avoid an old woman leading a cow along the road on a halter. 
Genevieve was thrown into the corner, Reichslinger with her and she became aware that his hand was on her <tag "516619">knee</>. 

800284
Right, no, I think there's definitely some work that needs to be done on the attitude of women. 
I mean I mentioned earlier the fact that it might be that people perceive sexual harassment, where in fact the behaviour has been perfectly appropriate and it's just that the person perceiving it is unused to it, but I think that's the minority of cases, incidentally. 
But I do think that women need to have much more of a sense of their own power, or at least of the fact that they're not as powerless as they think of themselves as being, and so they can say when the tutor puts his hand on their <tag "516619">knee</> or something like that `I'm sorry, would you take your hand away, that's not part of our relationship" or something that just &ellip. so they don't have to feel so bad about it.   

800285
Even if I haven't seen the labyrinth, at least I've smelt and heard Ariadne's home landscape. 
Back in Chania, the Calypso bar is filling with elderly Cretan men who click a lot: worry-beads clatter through their fiddling fingers, and they smack down counters on backgammon boards with ferocious violence. 
An old gentleman enters, in a traditional blue and black costume, with <tag "517085">knee-length</> white boots many times repainted. 

800287
`I'll see what I can manage." 
Martha dipped gracefully to let the waiter help her into Jo's old black redingote, which skimmed her <tag "516619">knees</> although it had been calf-length on the original owner.   

800289

Wondering how he could ever have thought they had a place in his life he stared at a vertical pile of Irish annals (1852 &dash. 1905) that rose <tag "517238">knee-high</> from the floor.   

800291
On the completion of the circle, Moran again had to recite the Last Decade. 
`Will we shut the doors, Daddy?" Mona asked nervously after they rose from their <tag "516631">knees</>.

She sat on the couch. 
She wanted to curl up her <tag "516619">knees</>, but the robe was so short she could not do so without revealing herself indecently to anyone who might be spying on her through a hole in the wall.   

800293
The Frenchman escaped with an injured little finger. 
Very few riders could find a good thing to say about the tight, stop-go track, but one man happy to be at Le Mans is Niall Mackenzie, his <tag "516668">kneecap</> almost completely healed after being broken at the German Grand Prix.

But Alida Thorne did not protest. 
She sat comfortably in the Matron's armchair, a new suede handbag on her <tag "516632">knee</>, and nodded.   

800297
Now he was down in Somerset: dairy, herding of course,  Friesians, and milking about 20 cows, 
three of us milked in the morning and two in the  afternoon, a long cow shed, 
of course my heart came in my mouth then, under the <tag "516619">knees</>  of all the cows.   

800298
Meanwhile the Wallabies yesterday announced two changes from the side that started the first Test. 
The Oxford Blue, Ian Williams, replaces the Fijian-born wing Acura Niuqila, who will be a replacement. 
The loose-head prop Mark Hartill, who came on for the injured Cameron Lillicrap at half-time, keeps his place because Lillicrap's damaged <tag "517036">knee</> ligament will keep him out of action for four months.

SAMMY LEE, the 30-year-old former Liverpool and England midfielder, is to train with Stoke City and may move from Osasuna to the Victoria Ground. 
Lee joined the Spanish First Division club from Queen's Park Rangers two years ago but has been sidelined with a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800301
He has taken to wearing glasses as a disguise which, given his physical characteristics, is akin to Dolly Parton donning trousers to go incognito. 
Gullit is bored with questions about his fitness, but some gentle arm-twisting elicits the information that he is `optimistic", and that the <tag "516619">knee</> is `not as bad as people say".   

800302
`Thank you very much." 
Ma Gaily took the cat on to her <tag "516632">knee</>, and settled for the evening, her plump fingers moving over the four needles.  

800303
Then Wally Watmough had called Frankie's mam a gypsy-woman and his dad a little black man, and the smaller boy, enraged, had attacked him without thought for the consequences. 
For his pains he received a black eye, a bloodied nose, a split lip, two skinned <tag "516619">knees</>, several bruised ribs and four strokes of the cane on each hand for fighting on school premises.   

800304
His rapping name gives the game away; KRS stands for Knowledge Reigns Supreme. 
This is a homily he learned at his mother's <tag "516706">knee</> as a little kid and through the thick and thin of the streets, parks and shelters, he never became too cynical to be ashamed of declaring his beliefs.  

800305
As McCoist gathered the ball on the right, the visiting defenders all moved in that direction, leaving their former team-mate completely unattended. 
McCoist found his international partner easily with the cross and Johnston controlled the ball on his <tag "516619">knee</> before beating Bonner with a volley. 

800306
Ludens, arriving, would have to intuit what was required. 
If Marcus, usually to be found in his bedroom, was sitting upon an upright chair, his back straight, his hands on his <tag "516619">knees</>, staring into space, in a posture presumably connected with some technique of meditation, Ludens would wait outside in the hall, or converse quietly with Irina in the kitchen. 

800307
At the far end of the corridor, almost in front of the large window, at that moment filled with grey light and rain, my father's figure could be seen frozen in a posture that suggested he was taking part in some ceremonial ritual. 
He had dropped down on to one <tag "516631">knee</> and with head bowed seemed to be pushing at the trolley before him, which for some reason had taken on an obstinate immobility.  

800308
I'm having physiotherapy as well at the moment. 
Any of my old school friends in Wallingford that know me {vocal sound="um"} well they'll just never believe that I can run 26 miles because I don't know if when you were at school, but when {vocal sound="um"} when we used to have a cross-country run I was the one at the back and usually the P.E. instructor used to go round and whack us with a slipper, you know the slow ones and I was unfortunately one of those, but {vocal sound="um"} now I've been running with the Bicester Road Runners for what 2 years, {vocal sound="um"} half, I've done a few half marathons, nothing anywhere near 26 miles, I've, my furthest run until yesterday was 16 miles, and yesterday, injured, with a bandage round my <tag "516619">knee</>, I managed 18 miles, and I'm pleased to say it's still holding out and I'm quietly confident that I'm going to complete this, and like I say, if I can {vocal sound="um"} well, just get the local businesses in Bicester interested and to support me, I say however small, just a, you know, if they, a penny a mile from just a few of the businesses in Bicester and, well, the Bible school could have, you know, a few pounds coming to them, which I'm sure

BORIS BECKER disappointed his West German supporters for the second consecutive year when a <tag "517036">knee</> injury forced him to withdraw from the Stuttgart Classic here yesterday.

It was no use arguing with them. 
It became a nightly sport of jolly Jews and Gentiles from the East End, carrying bundles of all they possessed, and hung about with placards bearing mottoes, to watch the upper classes milling around the darkened streets in their thousands, distraught and on the verge of panic. 
(They emerged &dash. the jolly Jews and Gentiles &dash. from the Underground stations, where they had `<tag "516686">knees</> ups" and lay in rows for Henry Moore &dash. he, remember, who could so easily have been our maid.) 

800311
It was a linchpin of Lewis's theism that thought itself was a metaphysical act; his exploration of this theme in his book Miracles and the subsequent heated debate between himself and a fellow-Christian philosopher, Elizabeth Anscombe, provided one of the great academic sideshows in the Oxford of the late 1940s. 
But of course, had Alexander's argument and Lewis's interpretation of it been irrefutable, had it been the kind of thing which compelled religious certainty, then all the philosophers in Oxford would have fallen to their <tag "516631">knees</> when they had finished reading it.

It's a new technology, but it doesn't have to be the best technology &ellip 
`  <hdl> COMPLACENCY </hdl>  Because every single aspect of this technology seems to involve genuine promise as well as queasy threat, it isn't always helpful to have a <tag "516647">knee-jerk</> emotional reaction.

He refused, and they attacked him. 
Mr Marsh, 22, recovering with cracked ribs, a bruised eye and <tag "516619">knee</> at his home in Moorbank, Blackbird Leys, said the attack had shaken him but he wanted to get back to work as soon as possible.

She left them there, negotiated the heaving deck and went down to his tiny cabin. 
The bunk was so small that she could hardly stretch out on it and she lay there, <tag "516619">knees</> up, staring at the ceiling.

Dunstable had three players sent off, the rest left the field in protest and the match was called off and awarded to Staines. 
Justin Fashanu, the former Norwich and Nottingham Forest striker, scored three and Clive Allen two in Manchester City's 5-0 home win against Notts County in a reserve match.

However, Dr Higgs said there had been no `set plan" for the different Cleveland agencies during the crisis.

800322
Worcestershire are likely to gamble on Dilley for today's NatWest tie at Taunton. 
He has still not fully recovered from <tag "517036">knee</> and hamstring trouble and played in the last match only because of the county's long injury list.  

800323
`So it would appear," Genevieve said, turned and looked out of the window.

800325
`I won't go unless I think I have a chance of winning," he told me in an interview for The Independent in October, and yesterday's decision confirmed that even what he calls his `invincible mentality" would not stretch to that possibility. 
The average athlete would never have contemplated competing, let alone winning, only four months after a serious <tag "517036">knee</> operation.

800328
BRACKNELL TIGERS' daunting task in Thursday's European Champions' Cup second-round tie with Milan eased marginally yesterday when Benoit Benjamin, the 7ft American professional, rejected a #900,000 transfer offer from the Italians. 
Milan, European champions in 1987 and '88, have searched for a new American since 23 September when Marc Iavaroni tore <tag "517036">knee</> ligaments in their first league match of the season.   

800329
The Yorkshireman, whose uncle Phil was an England stand-off and Cambridge Blue, has not started a match this term. 
His way into the side after recovering from a dislocated <tag "516619">knee</> was assisted by the absence of the double Blue Will Stileman, the only one of this season's long list of injured Oxford players not to be considered.   

800330
Six years later Idi Amin expelled the whole Asian community. 
In Tanzania the Asians suffered attrition in stages as the combined effects of the Arusha Declaration and the nationalization of both private houses and wholesale trade `cut them off at the <tag "516619-m">knees</>" as Nyerere expressed it.

One hundred and fifty-six whores and a bottle of pretty capsules which do not mix with cheese or broad beans or any fermenting thing. 
Daniel's left <tag "516619">knee</> was aching more insistently now, an elongating bubble of pain moving slowly through the joint like a rotting memory caught in ligament.

That an English hero should become so popular on historically alien ground is a phenomenon best explained by Charlton's instinct for being nothing but himself, a characteristic that appeals mightily to the Celtic nature. 
Last week while Bobby Robson was surrounded by players and coaches, <tag "517341">knee-deep</> in the paranoia that appears to afflict the majority of football managers, Charlton was fishing in Ayrshire, not seeking relief from cumulative tension but simply enjoying life.

Michael drove on in a dream. 
He could feel Toby's <tag "516619">knee</> touching his thigh, the warmth of his lean body against his side, his hair brushing his cheek.

I broke the over-sharpened pencil point almost immediately, trying to enter the paper and scoop into a third dimension; and yet three would have fallen almost as short. 
I unzipped the huge crushed-velvet pillow of the blue couch in the living room (where my sister and I sat drawing, and where years later, when I was at Eastman, I once lay for four days, banging a tuning fork against my <tag "516619">knee</> and jamming it into my ear and letting the impersonal, stewardessian purity of the A die away until I wasn't sure if I was hearing it or recreating it, in order to force absolute pitch on myself, while I thought about the machine that had crushed the velvet hard enough to leave the permanent wrinkles in which my face was buried) and I slid my hand into a permanently cool place, but was unenlightened: my hand wasn't really in the pillow at all, but merely between the inside of the velvet covering and the muslin of an inner pillow filled with stuffing.

`It was a pretty boring film."

This year wives (Mary Spray and Kate Hay) and husbands (Godfrey Eden and Nigel Holmes) decide to take separate holidays and, Brian Rix being Brian Rix, end up dashing about the stage in their underwear. 
`It's all innocent fun," says Robert, who has directed a number of similar romps for the Players in the past, `but oddly enough it's usually the men who are more coy about taking their clothes off than the ladies." 
Judging by my own knobbly <tag "516619">knees</> and other fringe benefits, I'm not surprised!   

800347
`Well, go somewhere then." 
Alison sat down, spread her legs, put her elbows on her <tag "516619">knees</>, and drooped her head.

Before the game Schillaci looked fated to become just another of Vialli's failed partners, and indeed Italy spent most of the match appearing to have taken this intractable problem into the tournament. 
The skills, positional switches and midfield runs of Donadoni and Giannini were breathtaking and Ancelotti provided the tempered steel of a Tardelli until forced off at half-time with a recurrence of a <tag "517036">knee</> injury.   

800351
Darren carried his bat for an unbeaten 135 in Surrey's 256 for four, having lost his opening partner, Grahame Clinton, to illness in the day's third over. 
Clinton, after scoring a single, fell to his <tag "516631">knees</> at the crease and was taken to hospital: although the doctors could find nothing much wrong with him, he still felt unwell on his return and was advised to take the day off.

LAMBOURN jockey Andrew Adams will be out of action for the remainder of the season. 
The 25-year-old rider, who is attached to Nick Gaselee's Upper Lambourn stable, broke two bones in his lower right leg in a fall at Chepstow ten days ago. 
He will be in plaster for five weeks and will then undergo an operation for the removal of a metal bar inserted to strengthen the leg below the <tag "516619">knee</>.

One problem here is the tendency for children to get the shoe on the wrong foot, especially if they have side fastenings.

They clustered in a corner limbering up and massaging their feet while Daniel and Bazza struggled to unblock the lavatory.

But for the most part he was, in Lewis's eyes, an `idle prig" who wasted his time cultivating well-born families and pretty boys and visiting exotic churches.

Like Bruant and Lautrec, the author also treated the Grenelle quarter of Paris, which he made the setting for `Le Bal de la Brasseries Europe&acute.ene a&grave. Grenelle", one of the new, naturalistic pieces that he added to the Croquis parisiens in its 1886 edition. 
This literary piece was an excerpt from his unfinished novel, Gros-Caillou, in which there was `a dance hall full of tobacco girls, foot soldiers, whores and cuirassiers". 
More explicitly, Lautrec's drawing (Fig. 96) and painted sketch of a laundress on hands and <tag "516627">knees</> parallel Huysmans's sketch about a crouching or squatting laundress in his group of sketches of `Parisian Types":

800376
In her ears were clips that matched the buttons on her costume jacket; rounds of soft brown fur lying darkly against her pale skin. 
As always, the scent of Californian Poppy wafted about her in perfumed clouds. 
Her legs were crossed at the <tag "516619">knee</>, and she was wearing her new wedge-heeled shoes.

Yvonne Murray ran this distance too, in preparation for her mile race in Edinburgh on Friday, and became Britain's fastest woman of the year with 2min 0.8sec. 
Her injured <tag "516619">knee</> &dash. she took a tumble in Birmingham two weeks ago &dash. still looks angry and she would be the first to admit that her place in the rankings only reflects the poor quality of the British specialists in this event.

The old light blue trousers with white leg stripes could be worn with both the four-pocket blue blouse and the khaki version. 
The 9 May 1898 order also authorized the use with the khaki blouse of new `trousers of cotton drilling or khaki colour." 
These were to be of a loose fit above the <tag "516629">knee</> and slightly tapered below to follow `the shape of the leg from above the calf to the top of the shoe."

And she told me that as she had worked on the structure she had had an idea for a mail-order product: the customer would send in his family tree, and its configuration of marriages and progeny would be built into a mobile, each generation represented by a tastefully graduated shade &dash. or, if that product proved too labor-intensive to make money, we might offer a do-it-yourself family-tree mobile kit, for older kids, that had telescoping crossbars and tags and Magic Markers for filling in the names of each relative. 
I told her she should write these ideas down, because she had similarly promising ones like this fairly often (for instance, a coffee-table book of yachts' interior designs), but she didn't: she had begun writing in a spiral notebook every night, but I gathered that it was mostly observations about the newborn Bug. 
I would bring her her glass of water and get in bed while she sat against her pillow with her <tag "516619">knees</> up, and I would stare from inches away at the lamplit overlapping-squares pattern of her flannel pajama bottoms (why didn't the ink with which the pattern was printed ruin the fluffiness of the flannel's nap?) and try to `read" by ear what Bug-events she had found noteworthy that day.

THE ITALIANS love a scapegoat, and the inevitable inquest into Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Brazil duly supplied one yesterday when the manager, Azeglio Vicini, announced that Roberto Baggio would be dropped for the visit to Wembley on 15 November.

Freddie, the superannuated wether, was so vast that he floated upright, like a ninepin, eyes rolling desperately. 
By the end, I was well butted about the <tag "516668">knee-caps</> and shins, drenched with sweat, plastered with mud and almost as well dosed with dip as if I had been through the plunge myself.
