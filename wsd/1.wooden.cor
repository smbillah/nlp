Mrs Adlam said that large equipment such as a <tag "523270">wooden</> slides was now needed She added: `The children are especially sad to have lost their mascot, a large rocking horse made by a Wallingford company."   

800092
But now they wait in far-from-quiet  anticipation for the main event. 
The pre-pubescent shrieks suddenly reach a crescendo as the  chugging electronic beat of the opening bars of `The  Locomotion" blasts out of the vast sound system. 
Pandemonium  breaks out as, flanked by a giant blue cut-out <tag "523270">wooden</> train,  Kylie steams on stage.  

800093
Wheels made completely of iron began to be used during the eighteenth century. 
Each wheel was made in sections and assembled at the mill, paddles made of wood being retained. 
Iron fittings could replace <tag "523270">wooden</> components gradually, allowing major alterations to take place over a long period. 

800094
The limestone scarps that rushed down to the sea and broke up into islands hung over the town, dripping green and yellow trees. 
Women sat under carved <tag "523270">wooden</> verandahs preparing vegetables, fish and chicken.

If there are messages in pictures I have got the message. 
I tell you, Ella, that those flat backdrops like posters &dash. deserted dodgems at the seaside or a <tag "523269">wooden</> impassive nurse standing beside a Red Cross van &dash. remind me of the bureaucratic life.   

800098
The garden, if so it could be called, seemed to have grown humpy, under a patchy covering of grass, as if a mass of botched graves had been attempted there; and under the window that looked out on all this lay, like a child's stick drawing of a man thrown sideways, the white rails of a broken plastic clothes horse. 
The light in the window was off, but Jean recognized only too well the chipped <tag "523270">wooden</> sills and flaking cream paint of Mrs Hyde's kitchen. 

800099
An excited buzz arose from the crowd. 
Then very slowly the <tag "523270">wooden</> supports sagged, the wooden surface sloped, the trolley inclined, and the bell, poised for a moment at an almost impossible angle, plunged sideways into the lake, taking the trolley with it.   

800100
A brown-coloured Ford Cortina Ghia car, belonging to Mr Stanislaw From of Villiers Road, Bicester, was stolen from a garage to the rear of the town's Chalvey Road overnight between Friday and Saturday. 
The thieves prised the <tag "523270">wooden</> frame from the up-and-over style garage door in order to get into the garage and steal the car valued at #500.   

800101
Alceste is a star role, but this wasn't much of a star performance. 
The eight dancers were really the main pleasure in a wide variety of expressive diversions with blindfolds and <tag "523270">wooden</> swords and sashes and much nifty stepping and jumping.   

800102
The Wallingford playgroup made homeless by a fire last month has a new home to go to &dash. as soon as it gets approval for a site. 
The concrete slab Marley building, bigger than the old <tag "523270">wooden</> pavilion which was destroyed in the fire, is the gift of a Guildford demolition company.   

800103
On the site of the present Conference Centre was the Grand Trunk station, originally belonging to the Canada Atlantic, J.R. Booth's line from Parry Sound to Co&circ.teau Junction (where it joined the main line of the Grand Trunk). 
This old <tag "523270">wooden</> station, which I remember, was replaced by the present building when I was six or seven.   

800104
This is the country's one remaining lamasery and its last vestige of Buddhist splendour. 
There are sounds of tinkling bells and subdued, mumbling voices as the monks, sitting in the lotus position on wooden benches, turn the pages of their scripture books. 
Outside they prostrate themselves on <tag "523270">wooden</> prayer beds.  

800105
where's my mother?" 
She appeared in the doorway (De Kuyper that is), sucking a <tag "523277">wooden</> spoon. 

800106
Keeping the same box-like set for each and using unsubtle lighting, Mendes's production dissipates this careful differentiation. 
Despite the Pickford's army of stagehands who swarm on in full view, carting off furniture and rolling up carpets, the ambience of each act seems pretty much the same. 
The only concession to an outdoor setting, for instance, is a huge branch of cherry blossom hanging like a <tag "523270">wooden</> sword of Damocles over the unheeding gentry.   

800107
If it is your first visit, you will be overwhelmed by the conception and execution of their designs. 
Exit from the Park is over the west park wall by a set of <tag "523270">wooden</> steps.   

800108
IT DOES nothing for a scallop to be wrapped in a hunky slice of bacon that would be more at home on the table of a hearty farmhouse B &and. B. There is nothing wrong with the idea of scallops in bacon, of course, but it needs to executed with respect for the shellfish, whose delicate flavour and tender white flesh are easily overwhelmed by the hefty sweetness of slices of big pink pig. 
This dish, and quite a few others at Cafe Rouge, seem to be starved of tender loving care, which is strange because the attention to detail that has gone into the styling of this off-the-peg French brasserie on Upper Street is remarkable. 
The white canopy over the front door, the Thirties style typography, the little <tag "523270">wooden</> desk from which you are shown to your table are all designed to make the thirty-somethings of Islington feel that a taste of turn-of-the-century Paris has landed in north London.   

800109
By 1871 a photograph shows it little changed. 
The first Melbourne station, at Spencer Street, was a somewhat larger three-span shed with a side building. 
On New South Wales lines simple verandaed stations with short <tag "523270">wooden</> platforms like that at Burwood were the norm.   

800110
We'll just take a quick look at the fruit garden and then I'm sure you should go inside and rest, and I must get on with my jobs." 
She pushed open a heavy <tag "523270">wooden</> gate in the wall and they came into the fruit garden.  

800111
Roberto's shot came at the 16th. 
In those days Open Championship crowd-control was done with miles of <tag "523270">wooden</> fencing.  

800113
RED IN THE face with hate and the effort of carrying a drum twice his size, the young Orangeman beat louder and faster. 
On the market cross above him in the centre of Keady, a fading Sinn Fein election poster had caught his eye. 
The frenzied din of his <tag "523270">wooden</> lambeg drum was cheered on by loyalist spectators on the pavement.   

800114
Excited herself, and caught in his excitement, she had not the heart to tell him to keep it closed. 
`They're here!" he called to her as soon as the headlights turned into the short avenue, and leaving the door wide open they went to meet the car. 
By the little <tag "523270">wooden</> gate there were hugs and cries, eager kisses, the calling out of names, Sheila, Maggie, Michael, Mona, Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose, each name an utterance of pleasure and of joy.   

800115
The six bells in one of Oxfordshire's oldest churches next to Chastleton House have been silent for many uears. 
The <tag "523270">wooden</> bell frame is rotten and will have to be replaced and the bells need re-tuning.   

800116
Owing to insurance problems the committee recommended the full council to drop the idea of building a ramp. 
But Mr Geoff Archer, who has championed the cause of skateboarding, said that a village in Oxfordshire had built a <tag "523270">wooden</> ramp and used the same insurance company as the town council.   

800117
A large new cellar was dug beneath the extension &dash. the most difficult task during the four weeks of renovation. 
The 96-seat restaurant is bright and airy, with light wood furnishings, venetian blinds and a new conservatory tagged on the end. 
Again, there are many pictures and off-beat decorations which include a post box in the wall and a rocking <tag "523270">wooden</> rabbit riding one of the beams. 

800118
Her head bowed and a hand went to her mouth, smothering a sob. 
Gower found himself beside her, on the dark <tag "523270">wooden</> settee with the tapestry-style covers.   

800119
Go across the roof from the passenger's side. 
If it's inundated that side too, then get out the useful all-purpose 4in <tag "523270">wooden</> blocks which I have often recommended in the past, and lash them to the soles of your shoes, thus creating a mini-stilt effect. 

800120
This rhyme used to be chanted by Oxfordshire children after they broke up from school for the Easter holidays. 
They went round from house to house, announcing their presence by rattling <tag "523270">wooden</> clappers and armed with baskets in which to carry the eggs and pieces of bacon they hoped to be given.   

800121
`We'll have to smarten you up before you say goodbye to the ambassador." 
HARLEY LAY CURLED in a ball in the centre of the red-draped bed, telling herself that this was the last time she would wake up to see the mid-morning light shining through the carved <tag "523270">wooden</> shutters and smell the stale tang of Kelly's cigarettes. 

800122
`The UK consumption of CFCs in 1989 was 33,000 tonnes, so this was a fairly significant leak," she said. 
A <tag "523270">wooden</> garage was gutted and the car inside it burned out during a blaze in a West Oxfordshire village.   

800123
I confess that the one-bar style of pub design is not always to my taste, because it usually results in the loss of the public bar as the whole place is hoiked up market. 
But here Peter and Chris have neatly succeeded in preserving the public bar atmosphere at one end, with a dartboard and functional mat flooring, while the rest of the room offers elegant carpet and polished wood furniture, fresh flowers and an interesting assortment of brasses. 
Low <tag "523270">wooden</> beams and a sturdy brick fireplace give a reassuringly traditional feel.   

800124
The interior design was carried out by James Nicholl of Hone Edwards Associates who has been careful not to go in for a heavy `river theme" which the pub and its location might suggest. 
The old tap-room, with its tongue and groove ceiling, flag-stone floor and <tag "523270">wooden</> settles, has been completely retained, but with the addition of a cast iron range found intact in the old cottage. 

800125
Not that he believed God was in the windmill, although, if He was, Henry did not think he was, yet, in a fit state to see Him. 
What he did feel was that Rush was quite capable of leaping out at him from behind a <tag "523270">wooden</> pillar or a display case of nineteenth-century artefacts. 

800126
Little is left, for instance, of the detail of the dining room where Emma Hart, later Lady Hamilton, is supposed to have danced on the table for the then owner, Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, and his pleasure-loving friends. 
All the ground-floor ceilings, with their rich stucco work, have caved in, and many of the carved <tag "523270">wooden</> door and window surrounds were badly charred and have been removed, where possible, to await restoration. 

800127
As this thumbnail sketch suggests, he is a many-faceted man, full of recondite knowledge and passionate convictions. 
He has no faith in art and no pictures hang in his light flat overlooking Chelsea Embankment. 
Instead, it's filled with books, small <tag "523270">wooden</> models of mediaeval machines (a serious passion) and modern furniture.   

800128
Mr Shabir Rana's two sons plunged from the window to escape the blaze which gutted two bedrooms, the kitchen and living room of the flat above the Continental Stores in Iffley Road, Oxford. 
Mr Rana, the owner of the shop, said he woke in the early hours of the morning to find the room full of smoke. 
He and his wife Bashiran Akhter managed to walk down the <tag "523270">wooden</> steps of his house but the fire was fiercer on the first floor and his sons had to dive for safety. 

800129
They found bottles of whisky, radio equipment, food and weapons caches, and at least one gas mask but no security policemen.

Cameras showed a <tag "523270">wooden</> lift linking Ceausescu's bedroom in the presidential palace with his bunker. 

800130
You'll catch your death with wet hair like that!" 
She waved the <tag "523277">wooden</> spoon at him as she had at Benjamin before, but this time with greater zeal, and hurried off to get him a towel, clucking and growling and scolding.   

800131
To start with, there is the clunking obviousness of Casaubon's name, a cod-erudite allusion to George Eliot's mythomanic clergyman and his abortive Key to All Mythologies. 
Just to explode any lingering subtlety, Unberto Eco even has someone ask, `Wasn't he a character in Middlemarch?" 
It is Casaubon, too, who supplies the most drolly <tag "523270">wooden</> lines.   

800132
At Southwell, real works of art have been commissioned. 
There is an impressive Christ figure, a metal piece by sculptor Peter Bull which hangs from the rafters high above the altar, much as the <tag "523270">wooden</> angels fly from the timbers of an East Anglian `angel roof".   

800133
All have gone indoors to avoid the storm. 
On the water itself boats are like baubles, defenceless against the brewing storm. 
On the terrace, the canvas chairs have fallen over, and so, too, has her little <tag "523270">wooden</> clothes-horse with its tea towels.   

800134
De Valois saw it and accepted it for the repertory. 
Its public premiere was at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, on 19 May 1947, first night of a tour which also brought the company a change of name, to Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet. 
The setting for Adieu consisted of a couple of pillars and a couch that was all too obviously a crude <tag "523270">wooden</> structure draped with material, giving the clear impression that the ballet had been mounted on the cheap.   

800135
It was, I think, the original university building (except for the western end, Moyse Hall, named after a Dean of not very long before my time). 
The floors were <tag "523270">wooden</>.   

800136
Four wins now in 15 matches since the championship was reintroduced still leaves them painfully placed in the regional rear &dash. the North lead with 11 victories in the same period &dash. but on Saturday the self-belief that Simon Halliday has been preaching and praying for finally materialised. 
The reward for the new captain and his side looked to be worth much more than mere avoidance of the <tag "523278">wooden</> spoon.   

800137
As we prepared to get off, our fellow passengers tried to tell us we were making a mistake. 
There was nothing for white people in Dhang: just a cluster of shops and shacks; stalls at the side of the road leading from the station; a bicycle repair shop; little <tag "523270">wooden</> shops on stilts which sold biscuits, cigarettes and sweets. 

800138
The editing is quite frantic: nothing is allowed to outstay its welcome. 
You glimpse a chainsaw buzzing through a <tag "523270">wooden</> crate marked `Bazookas", but the camera has already moved on, leaving you to imagine the consequences. 

800139
He swore vehemently, causing Maggie to clamp a hand over her mouth to stop herself from laughing.

Michael was about to utter some excuse and go when the <tag "523270">wooden</> door from the drive was heard creaking open once again.   

800141
How much of this is psychological is difficult to judge. 
Mecir, a `touch" player, and one of the last tour professionals to forsake a <tag "523270">wooden</> racket in the name of technology, advocates caution: `It depends on your confidence.

That the editor of a respectable newspaper can be taken in by them we find astounding. 
BRANDS Hatch Leisure have invested more than #1m at their four British race circuits during the winter break. 
At Brands Hatch, major revisions have been made in the Druids Hairpin to Cooper Straight section with the removal of <tag "523270">wooden</> sleepers and the installation of triple layer armco barriers on both sides of the circuit, allowing for extended gravel traps and greater run off areas. 

800144
It treads a fine line between the sublime and an innate ability to offend. 
A myriad of Victorian animal skins and stuffed animals, birds' wings, rabbit jawbones and wax effigies are embellished with gold paint, velvet, lace and jewels and arranged within glass domes, rough <tag "523270">wooden</> boxes and hollowed-out antiquated books telling magical tales of obsessional love, secrets and loss of innocence.

800147
The choir boys' song faltered. 
The bell had stopped on the <tag "523270">wooden</> boarding in the middle of the causeway and the workmen seemed to be scuffling round it.   

800148
This happened at the time when the long bow was finally succeeded by the musket and pike. 
Perhaps the two events were not entirely unrelated: it is tempting to think of a Tudor entrepreneur seeing the bottom drop out of the <tag "523270">wooden</> armaments market and so moving into lutes.   

800149
You'll be saving energy as well as calories. 
The set comes with a handy <tag "523270">wooden</> ginger grater and 200 15cm/6in wooden sate skewers.

I really thought it was a duck. 
I got to sit down after that, and I find a <tag "523270">wooden</> crate. 

800151
Like George Bush in Malta, Mr Reagan had hoped to put his feet up with Mr Gorbachev. 
President Reagan's idea was a fireside chat in an old Icelandic <tag "523270">wooden</> house, but because of his unwariness, the two men came close to agreeing to eliminate all nuclear weapons.

Designed by Jason Shulman, these grandly original pieces are available in both copper and nickel for #240 each from Joseph, 26 Sloane Street, SW1. 
Joanna Wood, 48A Pimlico Road, SW1, is one of those shops that sells charming fripperies, the sort of place where you can be sure of finding the very thing for someone who would prefer to buy their own toaster but who would love to be given a Limoge breakfast set or monogrammed shoe-bag. 
Pictured above is a beautiful hand-painted <tag "523270">wooden</> egg which, at #71.50, is at the expensive end of Joanna Wood's large collection of Easter eggs, chickens and bunnies.

800155
The friends' friends lived in the frozen wastes of the northern suburbs, in a squat, square house on a flat square lot. 
There were mesh screens at the windows, <tag "523270">wooden</> steps up to the front door, and a thick blanket of grimy snow disguising any individuality it might possess in the summer. 

800156
Any notion Senator Kennedy might have harboured that this week's celebrations of the Apollo moon landing would push Chappaquiddick into the background were dashed by a spate of articles and TV pieces dredging up details of the incident. 
Once again readers and viewers are revisiting the incident in which Ted Kennedy's Oldsmobile sped off a <tag "523270">wooden</> bridge and into a pond on Chappaquiddick in the middle of the night.

Long <tag "523270">wooden</> tables are loaded with bottles of beer and plum brandy stopped with twists of paper. 

800159
End-grain wooden boards, which have a chequered look, are the toughest and allow less knife penetration.

800160
The club's needs are simpler than those of the playgroup, whose new home will be sited on St John's School playing field next door to the Paddocks.

800165
Here the children had their own rooms. 
There was a huge but cozy living room with a fireplace, a library they lovingly filled with books, a cozy kitchen with two brick walls, heavy <tag "523270">wooden</> beams overhead, and an old-fashioned stove that Sarah insisted on restoring and keeping. 

800166
Helene Perraguin's Friday inaugural recital (in three conceptual sections headed: Child woman, Oppressed woman, Revolutionary woman) was also wildly welcomed by the 600-strong capacity audience.

800167
It's a more sophisticated Indian look than we've seen before &dash. ethnic but elegant.

And they find themselves with a goalkeeping problem &dash. Mickey Inotta is at Port Vale; Mickey has this been resolved yet? 
Yes Jane it has, as luck would have it I was late arriving, had to run through the rain, ran into the main stand and by pure accident ran into the Oxford United dressing room and there was Brian Horton, he said `Hallo Mick, how's the poster Mickey" as he always does, and in fact he gave me the team news and that is &dash. Ian Walker makes his senior debut tonight with both Alan {inaudible seconds=1} injured, also two other changes; {inaudible seconds=1} Jackson comes in for Gary Smart and one surprising one, Steve McLaren for Mark Steen. 
But one thing I can tell you about Port Vale, the ground has vastly changed from last season, the terracing's been improved, their seating, it's pure luxury apart from the press box, because I still have to climb that suspect <tag "523270">wooden</> ladder, and perched on top of the main stand is a shed where I'm speaking to you from Jane.

Even in a presidency capital like Bombay, it took some time for the station to catch up with the developing pretension of the city.

800174
In the late nineteenth century a succession of small lines had been built to connect the Malayan tin mines to the coast. 
It was not until 1909 that the spinal railway of Malaya was completed, connecting the rubber plantations to the capital, Kuala Lumpur, north to Ipoh and Penang, and later (after 1931) up the pan-handle to Thailand. 
The local stations on this system ranged from the simple <tag "523270">wooden</> building at Batu Gajah or Tampin to the large, airy, open-sided barn style at Teluk Anson.

He was leaning against a tree. 
In the centre of the road was a six-foot colour portrait of President Assad, an artist's impression of the Syrian leader in air force uniform that made him look like an elderly Battle of Britain pilot, eyes narrowed against the sun, gaze fixed on the heavens. 
The poster had been pinned onto a large <tag "523270">wooden</> board to the top of which had been affixed a very small Lebanese flag.   

800180
So while group founder Hugh Hefner honeymoons in his Los Angeles Playboy Mansion with his bride Kimberly, his daughter Christie has found just the group to market its fragrances in Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. 
It is European Home Products, best known for its Scholl <tag "523270">wooden</> sandals, support tights and bunion pads. 

800181
Smock or frock mills are so called because their shape is said to resemble a man dressed in a smock. 
Constructed from wood on a circular base, this type of mill was usually eight-sided, although six-, ten- and twelve-sided mills were also built. 
In this type, only the cap of the mill and sails rotate to work the grinding stones, so the <tag "523270">wooden</> walls are either sloped or battered to allow free movement of these elements. 

800182
The St Giles Festival is at St Giles' Church tomorrow for nine days. 
During the day there will be exhibitions of art and crafts, including work by Cherwell Art Group and such crafts as batik, knitting and <tag "523270">wooden</> rocking horses. 

800183
Pitchmen yelled above the din, nasally hawking their wares in monotonic diatribes while erratic explosions in the sky lit up the darkness, sending sprays of myriad fireworks cascading over a small adjacent black lake. 
Roman candles bright, arching bursts of fire blinding. 
A row of Hit-the-Gong machines drew contorted faces and thick necks bulging with veins as men sought furiously and frequently in frustration to prove their manhood, crashing heaVY <tag "523270">wooden</> mallets down on the deceitful planks that too often refused to send the little red balls up to the bells.   

800184
`The pattern shop first." 
The pattern shop was a haven of relative peace and quiet, reminiscent of cottage industry, a place where carpenters fashioned the <tag "523270">wooden</> shapes that contributed the first stage of the moulding process. 

800185
Even this was hardly big business. 
The initial sums were often quite modest as football clubs tend to grow gradually, first drawing crowds on a casual basis and then fencing in a field and charging admission; from this point a <tag "523270">wooden</> stand might be built and earth piled up into which steps could be cut.   

800186
But between 1942 and 1944, he was a Wehrmacht intelligence officer in the Balkans where the Germans were fighting one of the most brutal and ferocious guerrilla wars in recent European history. 
In the Kozara campaign against Tito's partisans in Yugoslavia, the corpses of civilian hostages hung on makeshift <tag "523270">wooden</> gallows all the way from Kostajnica to Banja Luka &dash. the two towns in which Dr Waldheim worked as an intelligence officer in the German army group `E" &dash. yet he was to say later that he did not know about the murder of civilians there.   

800187
The path between the yew trees was of clipped grass and slightly damp already with the dew. 
At the edge of the water, fringed by reeds, was a little <tag "523270">wooden</> landing-stage and a small rowing boat. 

800188
A much grander house, the property of a firm of solicitors, suffered similar treatment. 
Again, original, perfectly sound <tag "523270">wooden</> parts were destroyed and, to add insult to injury, plastic, press-moulded doors inserted.   

800189
Jointly owned by Peter Harrison and David Imrie, Furniture Village has established itself as a unique place to shop for a wide range of home furnishings. 
The interesting layout of the store provides mini room settings with some exclusive and original items like <tag "523270">wooden</> ducks or beautiful pottery pieces, superb coffee tables and tasteful prints.   

800190
She burped surreptitiously, still churning. 
Whisky, dry ginger and <tag "523270">wooden</> legs.   

800191
`Yes," said Gower decisively. 
He sat on one of the fireside chairs, a dark <tag "523270">wooden</> frame and cushion covers that looked like tapestry.  

800192
Torn posters and slogans covered the walls. 
Two apathetic women sitting on <tag "523270">wooden</> stools in the shade of a half-built shanty followed their car with blank eyes.   

800193
But Compass tickets, giving unlimited local travel for a day, will go up to #3.50 for adults and #2.20 for children. 
STAFF at an Oxford college broke down a bathroom door to find a student hanging from a <tag "523270">wooden</> rail, an inquest heard today. 

800194
The road to Auschwitz from Cracow was almost covered in snow. 
It runs through a succession of poor villages and we had to slow often to allow the farmers to pass, great men on wooden cans pulled by thick- necked, snorting horses. 
There were still <tag "523270">wooden</> cottages beside the fields, long barn-like structures whose roofs sagged in the centre as if they had too long borne oppression.

We want to be still here in 50 years, and stronger &dash. a proper company." 
RAY Cocking's small business has started to grow rapidly in the past two years, paying off for the effort put in since he launched the enterprise &dash. making <tag "523270">wooden</> signs &dash. 10 years ago.   

800197
What more occupied him now that he had contrived to remove to some distance the overwhelming thought of Catherine, was the overwhelming thought of Nick. 
Peter Topglass had been the first to suspect that the descent of the bell into the lake had been no accident. 
He made his own investigations and then drew Michael's attention to the way in which the <tag "523270">wooden</> supports had been tampered with.   

800198
We have two guides, Mike from Alaska who got the party together and a quietly spoken Tanzanian with the most penetrating eyes, who rejoices in the name of `God Living". 
Despite our light packs, the porters, who are carrying at least 15kg (and inevitably on their heads whether carefully-packed rucksacks, <tag "523270">wooden</> boxes or sacks of bedding), have soon overtaken us and disappeared from view.   

800199

More than 1,000 refugees, driven from their homes during the initial attack, were camped out on a school playing field. 
Many lived in rickety <tag "523270">wooden</> slums burnt to the ground as US planes and artillery pounded General Noriega's once-lavish headquarters at Fort Amador into a gutted shell.   

800201
The couple are now having to live with their daughter while workmen carry out major repairs. 
Ceiling and stairs are being completely rebuilt because the <tag "523270">wooden</> joists were fitted wrongly.   

800202
From the ceiling at the far end hung rolls of coloured paper ten feet wide. 
The white paper was in use for this shot, pulled down to cover the wall and most of the floor; around the edges stood a forest of lights crowned with silver umbrellas. 
The margin of polished <tag "523270">wooden</> floor, pockmarked from three decades of high heels, was covered with a tangle of power cables. 

800203
The opposition appears to have a strategy of attrition, in which even if it loses the vote, it hopes the continuing political crisis will force the President to dissolve the Assembly and call fresh elections. 
A YEAR ago, the Yantai <tag "523270-p">Wooden</> Clock Factory was bursting with pride.   

800204
When he sat down, Szymon Datner looked smaller and older in his brown zip-up jacket. 
He placed us at right angles to him at the <tag "523270">wooden</> table and rested his clasped hands on the surface with careful formality.   

800205
Nina Easton reports from the thick of the battle Jungle warfare 
IN a village deep in the South American rain forest, where trees tower over <tag "523270">wooden</> houses and shabby storefronts, a group of Brazilian labour organisers and environmentalists will meet soon to decide the fate of one of the most coveted film projects in recent Hollywood history. 

800206
At Bethlehem, New Hampshire, the highest village east of the Rockies, the Boston and Maine created a delightful, half-timbered chalet-style building with a great deal of space for the horse-drawn coaches and carriages which conveyed excursionists from the station. 
Even more elaborately decorated <tag "523270">wooden</> buildings with long agreeable verandas were built by the Southern Pacific at Shasta Springs, California. 

800207
`Rob will find it difficult." 
The other game, the <tag "523278-a">wooden</> spoon decider at Bath between the South-West and the Midlands, may also be affected by flu.   

800208
Boats were for hire by the hour and they had rowed on the lake. 
Afterwards they had tea in a <tag "523270">wooden</> cafe&acute. beside the lake.   

800209
Ah yes, this must be Birkenau! 
And I climbed from the car and walked to the railway line. 
There were the rails, the iron ties still clenched around them, securing them to the old <tag "523270">wooden</> sleepers.   

800210
WHEN Ariadne opens, a dismal-looking woman in a long white dressing gown is seen seated on a heap of seaweedy rocks resembling a throne. 
Around her are little <tag "523270">wooden</> shapes suggestive of waves. 

800211
it lubricates the gap between what we can see and understand, and what unhappy feelings haunt our dreams. 
Anne Baptist joined us as we explored her jungle garden before breakfast. 
She showed us trees with calabashes and <tag "523270">wooden</> fruits, and a thicket of juicy ginger stalks which sheltered huge, pink plastic blossoms. 

800212
Jewel purpose: You can't wear Annie Sherburne's jewellery and go unnoticed. 
Her `conversation pieces" , are bold, bright and very wacky. 
Hand-painted <tag "523270">wooden</> shapes are speckled with mock rocks and splashes of gold tend to be on the large, not delicate scale.   

800213
`Come on, you slags, get the show on the road," Kelly ordered, scanning the wall for the most interesting section to choose as a background. 
The clothes were simple white sundresses, and they changed in a lopsided <tag "523270">wooden</> shack that might have been a bar if the proprietor had been able to buy beer.  

800214
Deep purple: it wasn't a colour, it wasn't a thing. 
But Daniel was later (and now, again) to remember the feel and fear of this strange purple, drooping over the old wall by the coal-shed, drifting above the heavy <tag "523270">wooden</> lid on the well, gathering at his mother's white throat, or waiting shapelessly at night at the bottom of the bed, coiling up in the whirls and whorls of the dark chest of drawers.   

800215
The village of St Anton could have fallen off a picture post card: it's that pretty! 
The houses are traditional Austrian with lovely <tag "523270">wooden</> shutters and balconies; all the windows and balconies have boxes overflowing with bright flowers. 

800216
Many of the old stations were subsequently swept away. 
Irkutsk acquired a massive station, with two central towers capped by domes and larger corner blocks with connecting wings. 
Tayga's <tag "523270">wooden</> station was replaced by a much grander structure adorned with elaborate lamps.   

800217
There was no overturned chair, anything that had been disordered had been tidied. 
Three <tag "523270">wooden</> chairs were grouped around a dining table, the elderly typewriter was standing on the table exactly as she had seen it before.   

800218
You'll never give me what I want." 
She clenched her fists in despair and sat down on a white <tag "523270">wooden</> bench.   

800219
He pushed back a broken gate and entered a garden. 
A rough path crushed a way through wilderness and he took it, heading for a shed. 
This was small but sound, <tag "523270">wooden</> and fairly new, more or less empty except for a lawnmower. 

800220
Exotic fabrics proliferate in David Salomon's house, even masquerading as wallpaper (page 94). 
This year Yves Delorme introduced its Paon range of cotton throws: combining patterns inspired by the paisley motif with the colours of Provence, these rich textiles can ne used on tables, sofas, curtains or anywhere you please. 
In a converted cowshed near Devizes, curtains of every type hang from <tag "523270">wooden</> beams. 

800221
Later there were snatches of Indian tala-counting and rapid drum passages to match. 
Again, a wealth of instruments and strange sounds was used; again, to less powerful effect than the simplest drum played in vital continuous rhythm. 
Skeletal <tag "523270">wooden</> mobiles were rattled, feet with ankle bells were stamped, cymbals were stroked, marimbas were pounded. 

800222
Futons have proved a popular choice with younger people, as they are relatively inexpensive and ideal for bedsits and student accommodation. 
Traditionally, futons are rolled up and stored away during the day &dash. but in the UK more often than not, they are used on a <tag "523270">wooden</> frame which doubles as a sofa during the day.   

800223
His lofty thoughts forgotten, he examined the scene. 
A few rotting stumps in the lake beyond the ramp suggested that there had once been a <tag "523270">wooden</> landing-stage; and the woodland for a little distance around had been cleared, though now weeds and grass had plentifully covered the area. 

800224
He had assumed that so famous and distinguished a professor would have been given the best possible medical attention; it was the sort of assumption young men make. 
Here, suspended from Lewis's person, were pieces of tubing held on by rubber bands, an old <tag "523270">wooden</> peg, a bit of cork. 

800225
(Fig 26). 
Another problem which may result from the combination of timber with masonry is the deformation of brick arches owned to failure of their <tag "523270">wooden</> backing lintels. 

800226
The lunch hour is like a time warp &dash. give or take a few price increases. 
The walls are covered with original cream and emerald tiles. 
Without the restaurant's 10 grey and white marble tables, <tag "523270">wooden</> pew-like seats and two whirring overhead fans, the interior would have the atmosphere of a beautiful &dash. and meticulously clean &dash. Victorian public convenience.   

800227
It is utterly charming and so unsophisticated. 
Her grandfather carved it from a single piece of pear wood; its arms and legs are made of string, its shirt is just an old scrap of pyjama. 
<tag "523270">Wooden</> toys from other countries also fascinate me.   

800229
Recently, however, it caused me a bit of hassle. 
I was driving through a built-up area at about 28mph, in a fully working car, not having drunk any alcohol, and this suspicious behaviour attracted the police who stopped me and breathalysed me. 
Disappointed when they got a negative result, they searched me and found on me, among other things, a heavy duty cutter, a knife, a skewer, a length of hose, a grappling iron, a hacksaw, two big <tag "523270">wooden</> blocks, etc, etc.   

800230
A good source of information on almost anything is the Mount Hagen coffee shop, run by Maggie Wilson. 
It is a mixture of highlands and Western culture, serving deliciously brewed highlands coffee, milk shakes, sandwiches, scones and banana cake. 
White expatriates from the distant mine sites sat at neighbouring tables, and highlands men wandered in to sell us their artefacts: necklaces made from boars' tusks and hunting axes with elaborately carved <tag "523270">wooden</> handles.   

800231
I think she undoubtedly added to the intrigue  {vocal sound="um"} and difficulties of her court, 
one example, she was always getting people that she approved  of, getting them plum jobs, 
and one example was one of the governors of Oxford, the most  unpopular, one Sir Arthur Aston, who was so unpopular that  he got attacked on the street, and then had to have a body  guard paid for the city council, and then was curvetting on  his horse in front of some ladies, and fell off and broke  his leg so badly that he had to have it amputated,  so from then on he had a <tag "523270">wooden</> leg,

With additional payments, employees will get an extra 9 to 9.5 per cent bringing basic weekly pay for postmen up to #148.82. 
Photograph (omitted): WREN'S Great Model of St Paul's Cathedral as it might have been (pictured in the crypt of St Paul's) is being sent to the United States to feature in the world's first major exhibition of the architect's work, writes Jonathan Glancey. 
The <tag "523270">wooden</> model, 20ft long and 12ft high &dash. perhaps the finest of its kind in the world &dash. will be the star exhibit of `Sir Christopher Wren and the Legacy of St Paul's Cathedral", which opens at The Octagon Museum in Washington DC in mid-February.   

800233
But the CPR made its distinctive contribution to Canadian station architecture with its French cha&circ.teau style, used for both hotels and stations, and its wooden chalets with Scottish baronial touches. 
An example of the latter was Banff in Alberta, and of the former the great gateway to the Orient which the CPR built in Vancouver. 
When the first CPR train reached Vancouver on 23 May 1888, the depot on the waterfront was no larger than a <tag "523270">wooden</> shed.   

800234
The Colchester bomb exploded underneath Sgt Mudd's Volkswagen close to the married quarters area for Goojerat Barracks. 
The estate borders civilian houses and is close to Colchester United football ground. 
It has only a <tag "523270">wooden</> fence for protection and it is virtually impossible to seal off from the rest of the town.   

800235
The gold-sprayed basket of paper flowers was removed from the stage, and a placard set up informing people that walls had ears. 
As I steamed away from the junction on that bright crisp morning, the elderberries trembled as the earth shook with the marching hordes in the east. pomfret's brother threw over polished levers in his flower-bedecked signal box. 
The <tag "523270">wooden</> letters that spelt out the name of our station had been removed by my father's men; but, as when people said, `There are no flies on him," you could see where they had been. 

800236
`But I am a bit disappointed that while we've been appealing for new directors nobody from the town has come forward." 
Perhaps they cannot see potential at a ground shorn of its <tag "523270">wooden</> stands and surrounded by deprivation.  

800237
Cast-iron wheels were too expensive for the miller to install, so a hybrid construction emerged. 
The hub, bearings and rims of otherwise <tag "523270">wooden</> wheels might be made of iron.   

800238
The then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, agreed to be their president. 
The building, complete with its crude <tag "523270">wooden</> pegs designed for high-crowned hats and the uncomfortable high-backed pews which prevented kneeling (a Popish practice), is a classic example of Puritan austerity.   

800239
Both head and plate are best fixed with sturdy No.12 screws at around 2ft intervals. 
Don't try and hammer nails into the ceiling joists as you'll almost certainly damage the plaster. 
If you're fixing the plate to a <tag "523270">wooden</> floor use nothing bigger than 2 1/2in screws to avoid damage to hidden pipes or wiring. 

800240
By the time they arrived there it was about half-past seven. 
The pub turned out to be rather grander than Michael had thought, but they went into the saloon bar, which had kept its old panelling of much-rubbed blackened oak and its tall <tag "523270">wooden</> settles, together with a certain amount of modern red leather, coy Victorian hunting prints, and curtains printed with pint mugs and cocktail glasses.   

800241
This arrangement also produces a shallow perimeter `ledge", parallel to at least one external wall, which can be used as a window seat. 
This disposition of rooms made it possible to treat the residual high-level space as a single living/dining/cooking area, with the kitchen located at its northern end, divided from the generous living-dining-room only by a head-height folding screen. 
This arrangement allowed the elaborate <tag "523270">wooden</> structure of the steeply pitched roof &dash. now much closer at hand following the insertion of the upper floor &dash. to remain unmodified, an impressive preserved construction `oversailing" the new living accommodation.  

800242
This building was erected in the nineteenth century and was the first mill on the site. 
A stream, which is a tributary of the River Ouse, was dammed to create a large millpond which feeds the waterwheel. 
The structure of the wheel remains alongside the north-west elevation of the mill, although the <tag "523270">wooden</> paddles have entirely rotted away and it cannot be made to turn (Plate 43). 

800243
At close of play Leicestershire, 371 for six, were 175 runs ahead of Warwickshire &dash. whose Allan Donald went down with a groin strain. 
The very rapid South African will probably miss the next match. 
And in a draw-doomed duel at Derby, the current front-runners for the <tag "523278">wooden</> spoon amassed their best total in more than a year.

When the British Medical Association published its report into boxing five years ago Professor Bryan Jennett, a neurosurgeon at Glasgow University, said: `It has been proven that the knock-out is not the only way of suffering brain damage. 
The violent punch produces an effect similar to a blancmange being whisked around in a <tag "523270">wooden</> box.   

800246
They went for the throat or the genitals, and the smallest scratch from their long black claws could poison a man to death. 
There was a pipe jutting through the stone wall at the tunnel's mouth, a wide cast-iron duct that brought nasty stuff all the way down the hillside from the great well in the cellar under the stairs. 
On slaughtering days all the gates were carefully locked and a long <tag "523270">wooden</> ramp placed against the cellar steps. 

800247
You are assured of a warm welcome from Frau Hinterholzer, the owner. 
All bedrooms are twin bedded, although third and fourth beds are available, with a private bathroom, and some have a balcony. 
The Dorfwirt is a distinctive hotel with carved <tag "523270">wooden</> balconies, and the peaceful atmosphere is totally in keeping with this relaxing resort.   

800248
They began with a strong interest in Naturalism, but `we all soon fell, by and by, strongly under the influence of the pointillist theories". 
Bernard related that he himself eventually rejected Signac's pointillist stroke because he felt that it detracted from the true effects of colour and light, and made figures too <tag "523269">wooden</>. 

800249
Anyway, they've gone this hour." 
`You want the loan of a bob, lass?" A man who had been sitting silently by on the <tag "523270">wooden</> form got to his feet, his hand outstretched, and he said, `There! take it; and if you want to pay it back put it in the voluntary box she was talking about." 

800250
Her gaze is unavoidable, a sour, accusatory glare, her mouth a study in set, stubborn sullenness. 
In one gnarled, prominently veined hand she clutches a bible; in the other she grips a long <tag "523270">wooden</> crucifix as if it were a club.   

800251
The Drumsna wall cuts off a loop of the Shannon and is broken only by an entrance complex, 30 yards wide, which would have acted as a sort of monumental entrance gateway into a tribal territory &dash. possibly the embryonic Kingdom of Connacht. 
The survey succeeded in locating what the archaeologists believe to have been a giant post-hole in the middle of the entrance &dash. and if this proves to be the case, each gate would have been around six yards wide and at least four yards high. 
The entranceway was flanked by high banks protruding outwards from the main rampart and strengthened by a <tag "523270">wooden</> palisade. 

800252
They are a select group &dash. a tiny fraction of the country's 16,500 parish churches &dash. and there are some rare buildings among them. 
St Mary's Edlesborough, near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, has nearly all its medieval fittings intact and possesses the only medieval <tag "523270">wooden</> pulpit cover in the country. 

800253
Our guide was Anne Appel, vice-president of the museum, who, though English, has lived in Belgium for many years and we were soon engrossed. 
It wasn't just the items displayed &dash. guns, bullets, stirrups, even Lord Uxbridge's <tag "523270">wooden</> leg (the tomb of his actual leg is also in Waterloo) &dash. nor even the nuggets of information &dash. like the French soldiers who pulled out their front teeth so that they could not `bite the bullet", thus rendering themselves unfit for active service.   

800254
FATHER Christmases should take care, as they cram stockings, not to injure themselves in the way a 26-year-old woman did earlier this year. 
She worked as a tights tester, spending all day pulling new tights over a <tag "523270">wooden</> mannikin, looking for faults. 

800255
On the edge of the last decade of the 20th century, Russian farmers with a sizeable investment and more than 100 cows are still unable to get a commercial refrigerator for their milk. 
Opposite her brick house, the village street is a dirt track leading past a row of tumbledown <tag "523270">wooden</> houses to an attractive 18th century church.   

800256
At the moment there were two full ones on the table and a clean glass. 
Before she sat down she looked round the flat and was glad she had managed to tidy it, the sink, draining-board and stove clear, food shelves squared up, clothes on hangers and hooks in what was called a corner wardrobe but was actually a <tag "523270">wooden</> triangle nailed to the ceiling with a plastic curtain hanging from it. 

800257
The stories of the suburb, the tales that gave number 24, 59, 3031 or 47 their right to their homes, these were, in their way, as substantial as the creation myths of the Eskimos. 
Passats, BMWs, dormer windows, back extensions, <tag "523270">wooden</> garden sheds, all meant something more than at first appeared &dash. white wooden railings, gold nameplates on doors, stained-glass windows in bathrooms, net curtains, numbered dustbins, unnumbered dustbins, sash windows, plate-glass windows, windows with double glazing, windows without double glazing, walls painted white, all of this was part of a body of myth as strange and mysterous as the Epic of Gilgamesh.  

800258
The moment to strike may not be so far off. 
If women insist on playing a gentleman's game, why not banish them to their own 9-hole course and their own <tag "523270">wooden</> shack?   

800259
Miss Linda Stent, prosecuting, told the court that police were called to Riverside Court in Oxford on February 14 where Brain had smashed a window and was threatening one of the occupants with a 4ft baton. 
When they arrived Brain went into the flats, where he was squatting at the time, and came out carrying a <tag "523270">wooden</> club, shouting threats at the officers.   

800260
Sharpe slowed to a walk and drew his sword. 
He dragged the blade slowly through the scabbard's <tag "523270">wooden</> throat so that the sound of the weapon's scraping would be as frightening as the sight of the dulled steel.   

800261
It did not really make much difference to the rest of us, who were so enthralled with the extraordinary Paro valley that we would have been just as happy to have stayed at the `airport" hotel for two weeks. 
Its rooms were in a collection of <tag "523270">wooden</> summerhouses, carved and painted with flowers, symbols and Buddhist spirals, set among pine trees up on the valley's side.   

800262
And to complement your oriental meal, serve fragrant China tea from a lovely matching 1 litre/2 pint teapot. 
This heavy gauge Chinese wok with <tag "523270">wooden</> handle is 33cm/13in in size &dash. large enough to toss the tastiest stir fry for the hungriest family.   

800263
She battled to bring it into focus. 
Then with rapid movements she pushed the <tag "523270">wooden</> chairs out of the way, dragged the table into the centre of the room and looked up.   

800264
It is a right I reserve for all adults and one of the nicest things about being my age is I can do whatever I like. 
My tastes are simple. 
I have a <tag "523270">wooden</> regency garden which I adore setting up and rearranging. 

800265

The definitive collection is in the Welsh National Museum. 
But for the next month you can see a fine selection of love and other carved wooden spoons in the coffee bar at the County Museum, Woodstock, made by Peter Lister, the head of creative art at Cooper School, Bicester. 
Peter, who hails from Llanelli, has been carving spoons for a hobby since 1956 and is often commissioned to make love spoons for wedding presents, but he also gets great satisfaction out of producing elegant <tag "523270">wooden</> ladles and stirring spoons to order.   

800268
Trade unionists, students and the old and creased veterans from the losing side of the Civil War arrived in Madrid yesterday on board 24 special trains and 615 chartered coaches. 
So many wreaths were sent to the Madrid Communist Party headquarters, where the plain <tag "523270">wooden</> coffin lay in state for three days, that it took more than an hour to empty out the flowers.  

800269
Things improved and in Act 3, unencumbered by too many production ideas, she carried the drama convincingly. 
Alexei Steblianko's Jason was frankly a disappointment, and although an infection was rumoured, this could not excuse such <tag "523269">wooden</> phrasing.   

800270
There I don't want them to know anything {inaudible seconds=2}. 
The rival generals faced each other across a <tag "523270">wooden</> table in a green desert tent, General Schwartzkopk sitting with Saudi commander general, Prince <guess>Karla pin</guess> Sultan. 

800271
Visitors to the museum learn that the first public transport in Oxford began in December 1881 when horse drawn trams linked the two rail stations with High Street, Magdalen Bridge and Cowley Road. 
The basic <tag "523270">wooden</> shells of two of these 46 seater double deck trams are on view, but need careful restoration work planned for the future.   

800272
The rest of the village was on stilts, a Southend pier of teak, and we stopped there for petrol and beer. 
Oily water glittered through gaps in the teak boards as we climbed the gangplank. 
A plump old man sitting in a <tag "523270">wooden</> scaffold on a marine building site sawed the top off an immense teak column to make it flush with the decking.   

800273
Aberdovey itself is trapped in a sort of 1950s time warp. 
It's a modest little place and while it relies almost exclusively on tourism pounds it has retained its civic pride. 
The seafront is shaped like a dog's leg, with the <tag "523270">wooden</> pier in the centre dividing the beach &dash. a four-mile swathe of golden sand. 

800274
I did buy them plastic swords and there were good reasons for that. 
One was that every chop stick in the house had disappeared, along with every ruler, every decent-sized wooden spoon, and most of my garden canes. 
The other reason was that it dawned on me that they were doing each other far more damage sword fighting with bean-poles and <tag "523277">wooden</> spoons than they would with light plastic swords.   

800275
The pair of lions came from the old house, as did the birdbath, adorned with a stone dove, that stands near the bridge (`it's a whim") beneath the pear tree. 
Many of the other adornments came from tradesmen who had no use for them and were going to throw them away as scrap. 
One of her most attractive plant containers, an old iron circular feeding trough, stands on a <tag "523270">wooden</> cable reel given her by the cable company.   

800276
The purpose of the structure immediately outside the temple was not so obvious. 
The men hammering it together had beckoned us, beaming, inviting inspection. 
A raised <tag "523270">wooden</> runway, carpeted with the pin-sharp points of six-inch nails hammered through from the bottom, ran out 50ft and ended in a bed of nails laid on the grass.   

800277
And to counteract the shoddiness of his environment and its influence on his psychic state, Mr Biswas wants `a real house made with real materials &ellip. . 
He wanted wooden walls, all tongue and groove. 
He wanted a galvanized iron roof and a <tag "523270">wooden</> ceiling &ellip. .   

800278
It was these, not so much the explosions per  se that made the Krakatoa eruption the most lethal on record. 
Very few  people are known to have been killed directly by the explosions, great  though they were, but no less than 36,000 died when the tsunamis ripped  over low-lying areas all along the coasts, overwhelming towns and villages. 
The port of Anjer quite simply ceased to exist as the succession of great  waves washed over it, carrying away all the flimsy <tag "523270">wooden</> buildings that  made up the town. 

800279
He would never understand why the man in the attic had not betrayed him. 
In a corner of Frankie's room stood a large <tag "523270">wooden</> chest whose drawers were too stiff for him to open. 

800280
The next step is to fit an appropriate metal edging at the doorway, using a mitre block and junior hacksaw to trim the edging to fit neatly between the doorposts. 
On a <tag "523270">wooden</> floor you simply nail it in place, but solid floors must be drilled and plugged to take screws. 

800281
No British diplomat could be seen, nor French, nor Italian, although a Lebanese employee from the evacuated American embassy came along to represent the United States. 
The 58 deputies cast their votes in a glass and <tag "523270">wooden</> box while the ambassadors looked on beneath a Lebanese flag pinned to the back wall of the room.   

800282
Whatever kind of boat you decide to buy, consider the various options, the first of which is construction. 
Nothing in the world looks more beautiful than a well-kept traditional <tag "523270">wooden</> boat, but maintenance is time-consuming, and expert repairs can prove expensive.   

800283
`Inside, please." 
The priest backed into the sacristy, bewildered. 
`Who are you?" Osbourne pushed him down on the <tag "523270">wooden</> chair by the desk, took a length of cord from his greatcoat pocket.   

800284
There the panelled walls and worn linoleum were faintly illuminated by a rectangle of grey light from the frosted glass in the bathroom door. 
He sat down on one of the bare <tag "523270">wooden</> steps.   

800285
At the side stood an elaborate metal music stand which served as a lectern. 
The body of the room was unfurnished except for a few rows of <tag "523270">wooden</> chairs and a scattering of hassocks. 

800286
Seeking a satisfactory reason for the characters in this quintessentially German opera to be singing and speaking in English, producer Andre Engel has cleverly moved the action to an early German colony in America. 
Designer Nick Rieti's huge <tag "523270">wooden</> barns provide the perfect setting for this supernatural tale of a failed marksman who enters into pact with dark forces to produce charmed bullets that cannot miss his targets and therefore win him his bride.  

800287
As they drove away Craig turned to look at the sign again. 
It depicted a young man hanging upside-down, suspended by his right ankle from a <tag "523270">wooden</> gibbet. 

800288
He looked into the map room, but no one was there. 
`Duty Officer!" Sharpe shouted angrily, then, when no one answered, he hammered his rifle butt against the <tag "523270">wooden</> panelling in the hallway.`   

800291
Fine stone structures, confident in their detail with powerful round arches, were built at Petropavlosk, Zlatoust, and Kurgan (all category III) and at Omsk (II). 
At Tayga (III) &dash. the junction for Tomsk &dash. Ob, Achinsk, and Olginskaya (III) there were long, low, <tag "523270">wooden</> stations with twin gables fronting on to the platform.   

800292
She became gradually aware of an awful stench. 
It smelt not only of mud and rotting materials, but also the unmistakable odour of human waste. 
She paused to stare at a <tag "523270">wooden</> gate swinging crazily on its hinges.   

800293
Trying to get something for nothing. 
Every other Thursday afternoon at four o'clock until about twenty past she had this bald man with the brightly striped ties and the <tag "523270">wooden</> leg. 

800294
Mrs Colonel Trewin opened the gate. 
It was pale blue, <tag "523270">wooden</> and shakily nailed together. pushing me in front of her like a hostage, we walked down a path that was unusual, not to say interesting. 

800295
This was George Alexander Troup (later knighted). 
He swiftly established himself as a dominant influence in New Zealand station architecture and produced many remarkable buildings. 
At Foxton, Petone, and New Plymouth he created a new and striking <tag "523270-x">wooden</> style with multiple gables, light verandas, and canopies, often capped by a squat tower with cupola and finial.   

800296
Then on to the Members Lobby, where MPs mingle with journalists and feed them with `unattributable briefings", under the stern glare of a statue of Winston Churchill (among other ex-PMs). 
After visiting the Commons' Chamber (see above), you pass through St Stephen's Hall to the magnificent Westminster Hall (parts of which date from Rufus's Great Hall of 1099). 
The Hall, with its impressive <tag "523270">wooden</> hammer-beam roof (now ravaged by death-watch beetle) has been the setting for many key events &dash. the trial of Charles I, the lying-in-state of Gladstone and Churchill, and the parliamentary address by President Reagan. 

800297
Nonetheless, as much as any of the changes introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev, the new law symbolises his determination to destroy the image of `fortress Russia". 
Assuming the Supreme Soviet gives final approval in a few weeks' time, the move can only enhance Moscow's claim to host the Helsinki follow-up human rights conference which it desperately wants to convene here in the autumn of 1991. 
`We are no longer surrounded by an iron curtain, but by a <tag "523270">wooden</> fence," Fyodor Burlatsky, the chairman of the parliament's humanitarian affairs commission, declared yesterday, emphasising that for the first time legislation on travel would place all Soviet citizens on an equal footing.   

800298
The drawn criticism was of course freehand, usually with a grease pencil or sometimes with a conte&acute. crayon. 
I have not seen one of these pencils for years &dash. they were short and fat with a black <tag "523270">wooden</> handle, a metal holder for the lead, which was about one-quarter inch in diameter, and a softness somewhere around an HB or a B, something like an Eagle drafting pencil on a cool day. 

800299
On the pavement, though, two little Arab boys were setting off fireworks stuck in the earth around the trees which line the street. 
In the little square outside the St Antoine hospital, two tramps sat on a bench in the sunshine enjoying a mid-morning chicken carcass and a baguette.

Nell met him in the car at the edge of the town and they drove to the ocean at Strandhill. 
When they parked at the old cannon on its <tag "523270">wooden</> carriage there wasn't another car in sight. 

800301
The lake was narrowing to a point, and the car began to swing back to the left. 
Paul slowed it down to walking pace and passed gingerly over a <tag "523270">wooden</> bridge which clattered under the wheels.   

800302
Toby, turned now to face the house, waggling the oar vigorously at the back to propel the boat, waved to Michael. 
Michael waved back and came down to stand on the little <tag "523270">wooden</> landing-stage. 

800303
But `continued progress" is reported in implementing the recommendations of the Fennell report into the King's Cross fire. 
Installation of fire alarms and detection systems on escalators was completed in April and <tag "523270">wooden</> panels will be eliminated by the end of the year.   

800304
Then of course, when they've eaten they can't get out again." 
Our room was tiny and <tag "523270">wooden</>.   

800305
My tastes are simple. 
I have a wooden regency garden which I adore setting up and rearranging. 
I love <tag "523270">wooden</> toys, especially the doll that a local woman brought into the village antiques shop.  

800306
It's reckoned you need one and a quarter to one and a half acres per horse." 
`Loose boxes cost #3,000 each for pre-fabricated <tag "523270">wooden</> structures so existing brick or stone built ones are a positive plus."   

800307
Automatic door closers also stop banging. 
Impact noise, which comes through <tag "523270">wooden</> and concrete floors, can be reduced by breaking the circuit which is carrying the vibration. 

800308
Many were of wood and featured fine carving, canopies, beautiful lamps, and central towers. 
At Montego Bay there was an overall shed backed by a long building with an elaborate tower. 
Montpelier was stone-built with a <tag "523270">wooden</> tower projecting from the top.   

800309
Shortly after moving into The Kilns, Minto had engaged a gardener to help her with the eight acres of ground. 
His name was Fred Paxford, and he lived in a small <tag "523270">wooden</> bungalow on the other side of the brick kilns.   

800310
His prestige brought in recruits, and the recruits added to his prestige. 
He was England's Hindenburg, like him a <tag "999997">wooden</> titan.   

800311
A goose paddock was transformed into the garden. 
Following the demolition of a <tag "523270">wooden</> fuel-store lean-to that had adjoined the south-east elevation of the engine house, most of the restoration work consisted of the replacement of decayed material.   

800312
Part glazed front door gives access to 
13ft &times. 12ft with window to front, fitted gas fire with tiled hearth, <tag "523270">wooden</> mantel and back boiler supplying central heating and domestic hot water, tv point, picture rail.

Her eye measured the space between the table top and the chandelier. 
Rain snatched a <tag "523270">wooden</> chair, brought it up to the table, and used it as a step to mount the table. 

800314
We were to be reassured; he, too, was a man of the world. 
In his immaculately swept <tag "523270">wooden</> hut on stilts he gave up his box bed, and fed us on eggs and rice donated by the fascinated community.  

800315
Early waterwheels were made of wood, but as cast iron developed the miller made use of this new material for his machinery. 
Wooden wheels decay quickly with the cycle of immersion in and emergence from the water. 
Thus it is rare to find a wholly <tag "523270">wooden</> wheel intact today.   

800316
We could be moving towards a time when there will be more broadleaved forests planted sensitively and designed to give the public much more access to the trees. 
Begin at the estate office &dash. through the farmyard, turn right into a dark <tag "523270">wooden</> building with a tarred roof. 

800317
A STUDENT found hanged in an Oxford college bathroom, had discussed methods of suicide with friends two days before his death, an inquest heard today.

800318
But the community's organic quest proved harder than they first thought. 
It had been planned to use <tag "523270">wooden</> Canadian shingles for roof covering but the tree-felling policy in Canada's Western Red Cedar forests was deemed to be `unacceptable".  

800319
Collingwood Court, at Morpeth, Northumberland, was designed by Jane and David Darbyshire for C M Yuill. 
It consists of a series of linked courtyards, built in brick and reconstituted stone, with slate roofs. 
The careful detailing that so impressed the assessors is drawn from a fussy repertoire of turrets and heavy <tag "523270">wooden</> balconies, corbels and dripmoulds, giving a pedantic Gothic look.   

800320
APPROX 14ft 5ins &times. 12ft 1in. 
Front sash window, original fireplace, built in single wardrobes, radiator, power points, stripped <tag "523270">wooden</> floors.

When cooking, thread meat loosely on a skewer for well-done kebabs or push closely together if you prefer them under-done. 
Soak <tag "523270">wooden</> skewers for at least an hour beforehand. 

800322
At Omsk he was not permitted to photograph the station because its front had been removed. 
In the Far East, on the route to Nakhodka (Vladivostok is forbidden to visitors), he saw many old-fashioned <tag "523270">wooden</> stations stili in use, painted green or blue, each with huge iron stoves in its waiting-room.  

800323
Vic let himself into the administration block. 
The solid <tag "523270">wooden</> inner door was locked, as well as the glass swing doors. 

800324
Maurice vaulted the stile and, by a miracle, landed steadily on his feet. 
He passed the <tag "523270">wooden</> seats, ducked under the willows, and the last they saw of him was his undulating shadow.   

800325
The 70-year-old farmer was knocked to the floor when four men &dash. three wearing balaclava-style hoods &dash. burst into his home in the hamlet of Much Cowarne, near Bromyard, Hereford and Worcester, late last night. 
A farm worker was attacked, after investigating, by two of the gang wielding <tag "523270">wooden</> staves.   

800326
Essentially the same subjects, both professional and academic, continued in the second semester. 
Descriptive geometry went on into shades and shadows and perspective, supplemented by pencil drawings, on yellow detail paper, of full-size <tag "523270">wooden</> mill-work details.   

800327
He had had speech with the Bishop and seen him off with such dignity as was possible in the circumstances. 
With Peter, he had investigated the <tag "523270">wooden</> section of the causeway and discovered that two of the piers had been sawn through just below the water level.   

800328
`And now I am an old man and I remain only to wait for the bitter end of everybody in this life; to pass away." 
The road to Auschwitz from Cracow was almost covered in snow. 
It runs through a succession of poor villages and we had to slow often to allow the farmers to pass, great men on <tag "523270">wooden</> cans pulled by thick- necked, snorting horses. 

800329
Somewhere dark and slightly damp will be ideal. 
If you cannot find <tag "523270">wooden</> boxes, use large polythene bags for storage, but leave the bag tops open. 

800330
To antique lovers it is something else &dash. the home of the rush-and-cane seated chairs that are the best known examples of Provenc&cedilla.al furniture. 
They are immensely adaptable: designed for the plainer interiors of the hot south, they sit happily in stark modernist de&grave.cors, but don't look out of place in rooms stuffed with antiques. 
At their most basic, rush and cane seats provided more comfortable seating than the <tag "523270">wooden</> chairs and stools that preceded them. 

800331
Or rather, it stayed on the drawing board while the local representatives of state monopoly capitalism (as it then was) came and did their thing with power lines. 
Kate was so incensed that she went around the house for years frantically turning off all lights in the corridors until Alistair cracked a bone in his shin stumbling into the <tag "523270">wooden</> laundry box that lurks outside Sarah's room.   

800332
We began merely learning how to control charcoal, to control lines and tones, to use a chamois or a smooth stick, an art gum or a kneaded eraser. 
The first objects to be drawn were the usual pile of white painted <tag "523270">wooden</> cubes, pyramids, and spheres that used to fill up most drawing studios.   

800333
At the corner of Wealdlake Road, four streets north of Wimbledon station, was the ideal place. 
A heavy <tag "523270">wooden</> window frame, dusty glass and three big-bellied bottles, coloured with the bright, mysterious fluids Henry remembered from his childhood.   

800334
Charsky was in trouble. 
He was pressed against almost sheer ice, clinging on by his fingers. 
Somewhere not too far below him were the <tag "523270">wooden</> doors of the Gallery Window of the Jungfraujoch railway. 

800335
To observers in Hanoi, it is equally clear that the West, which has successfully applied a crippling economic embargo on Vietnam for the past decade because of its occupation of Cambodia, will have to give more serious attention to alleviating the social misery and hardship that is still driving people to the boats, not simply helping those going back. 
`For years we dreamed of living a better life and having a bigger house," the 37-year-old Mrs Tam says ruefully, looking round a room in which two doll's house-sized chairs, a tiny table and some <tag "523270">wooden</> stools are the only concessions to comfort.   

800336
Chris Humphries, senior London officer of the National Union of Public Employees, said the London Ambulance Service had received instructions from Kenneth Clarke, the Secretary of State for Health, to break its agreement with the unions.

SATURDAY NIGHT in deepest Transylvania, as dark as it can be on a moonless night in the countryside. 
Along the unpaved road, the headlights outline the carved gateways to peasant cottages, the tall spire of a <tag "523270">wooden</> church with four sharp turrets and a huddle of timber graveposts.   

800338
The more technical courses, descriptive geometry, shades and shadows, and perspective were taught by Philip Whitney, Professor of Graphics, and George Baumeister, then an instructor in graphics. 
We worked at first in pencil on yellow detail paper, beginning very much at the beginning, learning how to sharpen pencils (there was nothing available except <tag "523270">wooden</> pencils that had to be sharpened with a knife in those days), learning to control lines, what kind of eraser to use for what purpose, how to keep a sheet clean by masking or tacking down strips of paper to keep the instruments riding somewhat above the surface, how to rotate the pencil along the triangle and T-square and how to get the correct angle to keep the edge of the instrument clean by preventing the grinding off of lead dust in the line drawing process, and on and on.   

800339
There are few survivors of the first Holocaust because the Turks tried to kill them all and because age has now claimed most of the rest. 
When the sick and exhausted Armenians reached Beirut after the Ottoman collapse, they were allowed to build shacks on the swamps of Bourj Hammoud in the east of the city and then to erect houses which look to this day curiously Balkan, their <tag "523270">wooden</> balconies hanging over the narrow streets of Camp Mamsh.   

800340
In addition to the above, the exhibition contains theoretical journals, pamphlets and books, many of which were published by the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism. 
Following a recent trend, the exhibition organisers have commissioned the firm of architects Branson Coates to design the show. 
In an apparent attempt to compensate for the small quantity of work and its somewhat desultory disposition around the gallery, they have built massive <tag "523270">wooden</> trestle tables in red and black and set at a jaunty angle, to support the pamphlets and models. 

800341
I remember the hottest day. 
One of the fields had been ploughed and our job was to weed out the wiry roots and tufts of grass that the <tag "523270">wooden</> ploughshare had failed to dislodge so that the field could be smoothed out ready for flooding.   

800342
At Quebec the first CPR station was a simple two-storey affair with crow-stepped gables. 
But the CPR made its distinctive contribution to Canadian station architecture with its French cha&circ.teau style, used for both hotels and stations, and its <tag "523270">wooden</> chalets with Scottish baronial touches. 

800343
I could only make out the first one, which appeared to be Jesus Christ, though not as far as I could see doing anything religious. 
Mrs Colonel Trewin was looking around for a bell on a hall table to jangle, when a very small woman appeared through the gloom from the direction of the smell. 
She wore a flowered pinny and slid along the linoleum, in furry slippers, as Yellowbellies of old had crossed the Fens in their <tag "523270">wooden</> patterns. 

800344
The answer is Jose&acute. Asevedo, better known as Peter. 
You'll find him behind a small <tag "523270">wooden</> counter in the left-hand corner of the bar. 

800345
There is an invisible frontier just a mile or so on the road north out of Luanda, but it is more of a feeling than anything else. 
The run-down villas and cement footpaths give way to dusty tracks and <tag "523270">wooden</> shacks.   

800346
The `bijou rustic pavilion" as he describes it, still survives and has recently been restored by the Landmark Trust. 
Here too is Lutyens's design for a fowl house, a <tag "523270">wooden</> building perched on staddle stones with lantern and a thatched roof, a residence to please the most demanding chicken.   

800347
In order to `contain" the higher profile of the new, glazed aisle roof, the wall was raised slightly with new ironstone masonry, producing a parapet wall under a new sloping stone coping. 
The architect, Roy Toms, of the Waverly District Council, was worried about what could have been an unsympathetic alteration to a venerable building, but a visit to St Martin's, Dorking, another Woodyer church, confirmed that its architect had adopted raking parapets to terminate the aisle roofs there, and the discovery of this period precedent vindicated the use of this treatment at St James Court. 
The original suspended <tag "523270">wooden</> ground floor was entirely removed after penetration of this structure for the installation of the new cross-walls and their foundations showed that some residual sections were badly affected by woodworm.   

800348
The horses, meanwhile, crossed the stream and galloped hither and thither over watery fields into other parts of the county and were not traced until nightfall. 
He said that he knew about it before he was actually told; felt creepy while driving across the <tag "523270">wooden</> bridge that led to his house, going into his house, and finding two of his children watching television with as yet no signs of emergency.   

800349
They had all paid, all the cripples and all the nut-cases. 
The man with the <tag "523270">wooden</> leg.

the small backyard with outside lavatory has been transformed by adding a glazed roof, a coat of paint and a tiled tartan floor 
Above: 
`Wee Lachie" in the kitchen where a deliberately random wash of blue glaze over white eggshell paint produced this shade of soft blue covering the walls, <tag "523270">wooden</> panelling and window frame. 

800351
`They seemed convinced a whole lot of people had come up from the big city to show off, to be grandees, which was far from the truth. 
`When the cortege arrived a grave ear-marked, I think, for one of the Kavanagh sisters had been opened two doors down from Patrick's, which at this stage had a <tag "523270">wooden</> crucifix made and erected by Peter and crazy pavings which I gather were stepping stones from a stream on the homestead and mentioned in one of the poems.   

800352
If this seems a bit drastic, then at least get an expert to check the glass is firmly bonded to the frame. 
It is important that all window glass is properly bedded in so the pane cannot be slipped out by releasing a few retaining <tag "523270">wooden</> strips or removing pins.   

800353
To make this pure&acute.e of salt cod, bradir (stir or crush with energy) the fish, having first soaked it for at least 24 hours, simmer it for 20 minutes and remove the bones and fins but not the skin. 
With the fish in a large casserole, slowly add warm olive oil and garlic from one pot and cream from another. 
Pounding is done with a large <tag "523277">wooden</> spoon. 

800354
`THEY CAME into the patriarchate through the black iron doors," Bishop Roland Abu Jaudeh said. 
`They took the <tag "523270">wooden</> benches from the reception rooms and burned them in the courtyard, and then they broke the patriarch's picture.   

800355
