Potted histories of each game are considered in the light of the rise of professional players, the links between games and gambling, the political and financial interests behind great sporting events, and so on.

On occupational health, and I don't plead for those figures, because for a time, until Helen left to have her baby, we were fully staffed, and the number of inspections and the number of notices served and the number of prohibition notices served are very encouraging indeed.

The third division leaders took the lead after 35 minutes, Andy Much the scorer. 
Minutes later the Wolves struck again, with the <tag "512617">amazing</> Steve Bull scoring his 31st goal of the season, not one of the better ones though with the Hereford defence in a tangle.

With two excellent midwives giving advice and encouragement, Debbie was born very fast and I seemed to recover almost immediately.

800283
The difference is that they take place within an agreed plan and programme. 
What is <tag "512617">amazing</>, therefore, is that the agency that has the responsibility for this programme &dash. Milton Keynes Development Corporation &dash. has been largely wound down over the past few years and the remainder of it will cease to exist in 1992. 

800284
The first thing to do is clean the plane really thoroughly. 
It's <tag "512617">amazing</> the number of snags you can stumble across by removing dirt and grime from every accessible &dash. and not so accessible &dash. spot.   

800285
People live too much in the present to worry much about what went on so long ago. 
There are two of everything in the village, and one wonders how they make a living &dash. a doubling-up of butcher, baker, grocer, hairdresser, doctor, and masseur, as well as two places of worship, which is <tag "512617">amazing</> in a place of 1,200 people, giving the atmosphere of a small town rather than a village.   

800286
I played a couple of tracks to Hugh and he liked them very much and wanted to hear some more, so I took some more up to him. 
It so happened that Hugh was the man who had been producing Tony Newley and he said to me after listening to those tracks that this was the most exciting thing to come into his room since Tony Newley which I thought was quite <tag "512617">amazing</> since, some time later, David was quite infatuated with the work of Newley.   

800287
Yes, that's one of the interesting things about this. 
When I first saw it, when I was looking at it, I was <tag "512619">amazed</> at these huge great hooks and eyes, and I thought `gosh, they can't have been very good at making hooks and eyes if they had to make them so big".

Although Jaguar officially limited itself to expressing `surprise" at the waiving of the golden share, executives were incensed with Mr Ridley. 
One said: `It was a quite <tag "512617">amazing</> piece of political ineptitude.

Thus it behoves the person first down in the morning &dash. usually me &dash. to step high and warily until the extent of the night's massacre has been ascertained. 
Every day I am <tag "512619">amazed</> at the hit-rate: from the corpses brought in one would imagine that no rodent survives within miles of the house; yet Jasper has grown into a three-mice-a-day fellow, and seems to have no trouble finding new blood. 

800291
It's very difficult to put a finger on what it was that attracted me about him. 
I think, first of all, it was his <tag "512617">amazing</> confidence and great personality. 

800292
Powerful images rage through my brain. 
What <tag "512619">amazes</> me is that, in spite of the horrific nature of what I have seen, I feel neither repulsion nor revulsion.

Not only can he do an impression of Alec Guinness as Lawrence just after he's been buggered by the Turks, but in one tale he tells of a poetry evening where Michael Hordern recites Betjeman, Richard Burton does Dylan Thomas, Cyril Kusack does Yeats, but the one that knocks them out is when Victor recites &dash. you guessed it &dash. a poem by the famous poet V. Spinetti. 
The poem is so <tag "512617">amazing</> that Richard recites it later to a gathering of Hollywood illumini.  

800294

The girls were awakened and taken across in the first convoy, the boys in the next. 
Skates were tied on the wrong feet; some boys were trying to remember when they had last changed their socks; the smell was incredible.

800298
The world must be grateful to Charles Richards for his exposure (`Intifada brings out the best in Israel's black art", 30 September) of the depths to which Israelis will sink in what he rightly describes as their news manipulation. 
Can there be anything more telling about the deviousness of these people than his account of how they actually put on television and interviewed a man who was said to have died while in a prison cell, and that, moreover, they did it with the sole motive of demonstrating that he was alive and in good health. 
They did it `hastily" too, which is also an indication of their <tag "512617">amazing</>, but altogether typical, ruthlessness.

Everyone knows that, it goes back a long way. {vocal sond="um"} what we don't know, perhaps, is how to create confidence is what is obviously a technological revolution, an expanding area, something entirely new. 
At the university here we have got two or three groups in which we do know how to do that and especially the work that I'm associated with, again the arts undergraduates, we have developed over a period now of something like six years, ways of giving them confidence, and it's <tag "512617">amazing</> to see what happens.

Havard came over from Oxford by car and had lunch with them and afterwards they all walked through the hamlets of Horcott and Whelford.

A glance to seaward revealed a sight that never ceases to <tag "512619">amaze</> us: the dramatic change from a deep ultramarine blue to the most glorious translucent light blue that occurs in these waters at around 100ft (30m).   

800306
From the outset, official statements have emphasised that it would be a measured and painstaking inquiry. 
No <tag "512617">amazing</> revelations were to be expected.

McKenna's is a `family show", but is it guilty of ridiculing unsuspecting prey?

It would live in others' eyes but not in his. 
He had never realized when he was in the midst of confident life what an <tag "512617">amazing</> glory he was part of.

He's a superb Secretary for Trade and Industry, and I shall be here answering questions every Tuesday and Thursday, and I hope one day he may know how to ask a good one. 
In a second challenge over entry into the ERM, the Prime Minister said she was <tag "512619">amazed</> by the small mindedness of the opposition benches.

He then describes how, by cupping the left wrist at the top of the swing, he eliminated the hook, aided by fewer left-hand knuckles, and practice. 
Anyway, let's leap away across the Atlantic to the Palace of Golfing Dreams because, frankly, they don't give a toot about anything, other than next weekend's 5-hour fourball &ellip 
American seem <tag "512619">amazed</> that the wife of Denis Thatcher, the famous left-handed player, is no longer the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

It slouches along like a fearful parody of John Huston's Fat City, the hem of whose garment it is scarcely able to touch. 
Not since that <tag "512617">amazing</> biblical epic, whose name I simply can't recall, showed the Jews arriving at the Promised Land with a drinks van in the rear, has a film tried to be so mortifyingly noble without the slightest hope of transcending its basic daftness. 

800315
It did more than that for me, and I hope may for others. 
It did also, in the end, illuminate the poems &dash. both Wordsworth and Coleridge are all of a piece, from their personal relations to their beliefs about society and the universe, and the more one knows, the more <tag "512617">amazing</> their achievement seems.   

800316
The cold Houston ball-carriers fumbled seven times, but Warren Moon, accustomed to the cold from his days in the Canadian Football League, could still throw, and with a last-minute score, Houston prevailed. 
Two teams which had to win to retain realistic play-off hopes &dash. the Los Angeles Raiders and the Cincinnati Bengals &dash. did. 
The Bengals shut out the Cleveland Browns, thanks to Boomer Esiason's passes and Tim McGee's <tag "512617">amazing</> catches.

According the Consumers' Association, the supposedly great British banger has a lot to answer for. 
Under its skin, instead of succulent cuts of prime meat you're much more likely to get all sorts of other things instead. 
The deputy editor of Which, Judith Gubby, although she's not a banger fan herself, munched her way through two dozen different varieties, says you'd be <tag "512619">amazed</> at what's inside.
