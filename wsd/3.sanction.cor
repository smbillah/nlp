Like Mrs Thatcher, he is against more sanctions &dash. but unlike her he is keeping his powder dry and the South Africans guessing. 
Britain has already let it be known that it would veto a UN sanctions resolution. 
If Washington wishes to extend <tag "506385">sanctions</>, it will have to persuade South Africa's other trading partners to implement the same package.   

800002
Margaret Thatcher has elsewhere repeated many times, and with evident sincerity, that she hates apartheid. 
Her argument that economic <tag "506385">sanctions</> are not the best means of promoting change in South Africa is not merely tenable but shared by some well-informed and unimpeachably liberal members of the white opposition in South Africa.   

800003
The amendment was defeated by 152 votes to 55, a government majority 97. 
Later, Lord Hesketh disclosed that it was planned to appoint two independent advisors, an academic and a businessman, as local government ombudsmen for England; but he rejected calls to give them `teeth" in the form of legal <tag "506384">sanctions</>.

The British statement was intended to show Britain's positive response and to chart the way ahead. 
Mr Major said the whole thrust of the Commonwealth communique signed by all member countries was that punitive <tag "506385">sanctions</> were ineffectual.

The ANC is split. 
The ultras see every sign of Pretoria's weakness as proof of the need for another turn of the sanctions screw. 
The `moderates", close to Mandela, are by no means ready yet to say in public what they are privately prepared to acknowledge: that <tag "506385">sanctions</> have done their work, by forcing the NP leadership to sue for peace, but have little more to contribute. 

800008
Both, as she would see it, have an interest in suborning Britain's national interest to theirs; both are in the business of suborning reality to dream. 
Hypocrisy is the vice of both: in the European Community they get us to agree to things which we then do but they do not; the Commonwealth legislates <tag "506385">sanctions</> then breaks them while we, the ever law-abiding British, obey.

What should they do? 
Outbid the government by demanding further <tag "506385">sanctions</>, even at the risk of war, and thus estrange the pacifists?

In turn, given the effect films, books and magazines have on people's minds, the odds improve that South Africa may, with the twenty-first century looming, enter the twentieth. 
WHILE 48 of the 49 members of the Commonwealth yesterday backed continued sanctions against South Africa and called for new efforts to apply financial pressure, Britain formally dissented from four items and, in a remarkable self-justifying statement at the end of the Heads of Commonwealth Governments meeting, expressed its fundamental disagreement with the policy of the whole Commonwealth. 
Britain formally rejected a paragraph accepting that <tag "506385">sanctions</> had begun to influence the policies of South Africa and would not endorse a report of foreign ministers which reached that conclusion.

800016
Britain also agreed that this was not the time to consider any relaxation of existing sanctions and pressures, though throughout the conference British officials had argued South Africa should be rewarded for its moves towards liberalisation. 
Britain accepted that all current sanctions should stay in place and joined the call for the international community to maintain theirs. 
In spite of the desperate efforts of British officials, the Commonwealth decided to try to tighten financial <tag "506385">sanctions</> and to review the situation in six months.

Baldwin was right. 
Hugh Dalton, the most strenuous of Labour politicians for resistance to Germany, said on 26 March: `Public opinion in this country would not support, and certainly the Labour party would not support, the taking of military <tag "506385">sanctions</> or even of economic sanctions against Germany at this time." 

800022
For, besides the materialist qualities, the spiritual quality of commitment and feeling is as present between homosexual as between heterosexual partners. 
Equally, I am prepared to advocate that, in historical terms, the time has arrived, in the absence of other viable legal institutions, to forsake the requirement of bisexuality and thus abandon the negative definitive criterion of homosexuality, if indeed it is such a criterion. 
Another argument I must meet is that while it is one thing to tolerate behaviour and remove criminal <tag "506384">sanctions</>, in this case concerning homosexual activities, it is quite another thing to facilitate and give recognition to unions built on such activities.   

800023
Significantly, the Commission did not suggest that such longer periods of detention could ever be justified by the desire to continue questioning or by the need further to interrogate. 
As a safeguard, they recommended that a magistrates' court should be required to <tag "506429">sanction</> any detention after twenty-four hours and that the suspect should be legally represented at this stage, so that his or her point of view could be put across.

I entirely agree that Thames Water must carry out large investments to bring its water and sewage services up to standard, and I am one of those who have pressed them to do so in the past. 
But frankly I am ashamed that it has taken an outside body, the European Commission, to force Thames Water into action under threat of legal <tag "506384">sanction</>.

This can be achieved by walking the river and  talking through the various problems with the engineer, the farmer, and an  environmentalist. 
Whether the latter is a landscape architect or an ecologist or  both, he must have in his hands an adequate ecological survey of the river in  question produced, or at the very least <tag "506429">sanctioned</>, by the Nature Conservancy  Council and the local naturalists' trust.

Toby simply could not see himself helping Dora to make the substitution of the bells; and this being so he rather cravenly felt that he was absolved from attempting it. 
Yet without Dora's <tag "506383">sanction</> to abandon the plan, to betray her, who had so simply and completely relied upon him, was unthinkable too.

Otherwise the man in the street in Hong Kong who did not get special treatment would feel `unjustifiable discrimination". 
The mood among MPs, as Hong Kong lobbies furiously, is fluctuating as to detail, although few support the Ashdown position which, the Democrat leader told MPs, reflected `the New Model Labour Party's first moral challenge" which it had failed. 
On the question of <tag "506385">sanctions</>, the Labour front bench demanded the withdrawal of Department of Trade sponsorship of the 48 Group of businessmen's imminent trip to Beijing and attacked as `particularly repulsive" attempts by tour operators to cash in on Tiananmen Square itself.

The Policy Review document proposes a larger stride back to the unpopular past than many people expected. 
It suggests re-legalising secondary action provided the workers in question have `a genuine interest" in the main dispute: waffly phrase, sending shudders up the spine. 
It would also appear to promise that all effective <tag "506384">sanctions</> will be removed which impose on unions an incentive to obey the law.   

800034
Now of course, some people might say well the Iranians {vocal sound="um"} haven't covered themselves with glory one way and another in the last few years, and that of course, is true. 
But unfortunately, in international relations, you have to {vocal sound="um"} work with, with the grain, and if it is a case that the Iranians are taking a fairly {vocal sound="um"} tough line on Iraq, well this is clearly to be encouraged because Saddam Hussein must be {vocal sound="um"} surrounded, he must be isolated, the <tag "506385">sanctions</> must work, and I'm sorry to say this, but the country of Iraq must suffer in order that those sanction work, because if it doesn't suffer, and if the sanctions don't work, there is a danger of war, and that will be immensely costly to our side as well as being the end for Saddam Hussein.

This de Valera, in his turn, rejected.

Bubbling underneath a difficult moral dilemma is a more far-reaching regulatory dilemma created by the very existence of the BSC. 
For it is the IBA's regulatory successor, the Independent Television Commission, which will have responsibility for monitoring the performance of contractors and imposing <tag "506384">sanctions</> on transgressors. 

800037
We don't seem to have any influence on American policy, and yet without us I think American policy would not appear credible in Europe. 
But if we look at what we now know to be the case &dash. which is that Saddam Hussein has an enormous war machine, that he was a tremendous threat in the region &dash. how, without going to war, and through the mere sustaining of sanctions, do you reduce that threat? 
My own belief, which is shared, oddly enough, by the head of the CIA, William Webster, is that <tag "506385">sanctions</> would have eroded his military capacity so much that, given another nine months or so &dash. assuming we has used that period for more flexible diplomacy, which we notably failed to do &dash. then we could either have got him out by negotiation, or we could have promoted a situation inside Iraq in which he couldn't fight.

Should the soya bean dispute erupt into a full-fledged trade war, it would prove much more costly than the conflict about hormones in beef. 
In January, America imposed sanctions which caused losses of $100million (#66.7million) in EC exports to protest against the Community's move on hormone-fed meat. 
Since then, talks have failed to provide a formula for the US to reduce or lift its <tag "506385">sanctions</>.

An industrial tribunal has ruled that the union acted unlawfully when it took action against 11 South Tyneside members who disobeyed instructions to join the national stoppages. 
The cases are believed to be the first brought under the so-called `scabs" charter' provisions of the 1988 Employment Act which forbid unions imposing <tag "506384">sanctions</> on members who ignore industrial action instructions even if a ballot has been held.

What lies at the heart of their cause is an ancient dream &dash. of a time when the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the `lion shall eat straw like the ox". 
Until that distant day our stewardship of animals will continue to be a struggle, but one in which we have the humanising opportunity to refine our gentility or debase ourselves in cruelty. 
The following night a disturbing Everyman (BBC 1) showed that cruelty against our own species is sometimes <tag "506429?">sanctioned</> by millenarian fantasy rather than deterred by it.

It would be impossible to persuade anyone to act as trustee unless the discretion entrusted to him were very liberally conferred, and it is now possible for a trustee to delegate to an agent, not merely pieces of business requiring especial skill, but the whole business of the trust, and escape liability so long as he acts in good faith. 
In cases of doubt, a trustee may protect himself by obtaining, at the cost of the trust property, the direction of the court, and the Trustee Act 1925, s. 61, had enabled the court to relieve a trustee, who has acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to be excused, from liability for breach of trust. 
The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 gives the court wide powers to vary trusts and <tag "506429">sanction</> dealings with trust property in the interests of beneficiaries.

WHILE John McEnroe and Michael Chang were winning their opening matches in the Silk Cut Championships at Wembley yesterday, and Jimmy Connors was packing his bags, the men's professional tennis faced another political dilemma. 
The story of the proposed Grand Slam Cup, worth dollars 6m (about #3.8m) to an elite eight players and dollars 2m to developing tennis nations, took another twist. 
The West German Tennis Federation declared that it would `neither approve nor <tag "506429">sanction</>" the tournament, due to be held in that country in December next year.

In contrast, Mrs Thatcher said the new measures agreed at Nassau 1985 were a `teeny-weeny" concession on her part and has never concealed her contempt for sanctions since. 
The sanctions Mrs Thatcher inherited or has agreed to are implemented with minimum policing. 
President Reagan's veto of a <tag "506385">sanctions</> Bill in 1986 made him vulnerable to allegations that he was protecting apartheid.

President Mugabe aroused the students' anger last weekend with a speech accusing them of drinking and smoking too much and misbehaving rather than studying. 
MARGARET THATCHER said yesterday she intends to maintain Britain's opposition to sanctions against South Africa at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference later this month. 
Answering questions from black South African journalists, Mrs Thatcher said the British attitude on <tag "506385">sanctions</> would not provoke any break with countries such as Zimbabwe or Zambia.   

800053
They were told by the Foreign Office in London last weekend that the price of British support was the removal of key elements in the OAU document which endorsed the ANC's position and on which the UN document is based. 
Among these were: Removal of references to `comprehensive mandatory sanctions" &dash. replaced by `concerted and effective measures". 
The offer to lift <tag "506385">sanctions</> against South Africa if there is `clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes". 

800054
Britain also refused to support the establishment of an independent agency to review and report on South Africa's financial links, and said that it would instead devote the money which would have gone to fund such an agency to the support of black South Africans. 
Finally, Britain voted against the Australian-Canadian proposal to review the situation in six months' time, with the implied threat that new <tag "506385">sanctions</> would then be applied if South Africa had not begun to dismantle the apartheid system.

It was a confused election. 
Essentially both Labour and the National parties, apart from a few extremists on either side, were saying the same thing: all sanctions short of war. 
Labour implied that the government were not operating <tag "506385">sanctions</> seriously; Conservatives alleged that Labour, if in power, would topple over into war.

Frank Sinatra has been there, and Elton John, and even a group called the Berlin Commando &dash. jolly old fellows who had once been lethal &dash. had plans to go there when I joined them at Frankfurt airport. 
They were going for the gaming tables, the crocodile farm and the shows.

She claimed that major progress is being made towards the establishment of a 72-hour maximum week and that problems of excessive hours only now persist in the paediatric, accident and obstetric departments. 
If, like me, she had a recently qualified house physician in the family she would be acutely aware of the following facts: a houseman in as modern a hospital as Oxford's John Radcliffe has to sign a contract for 104 hours a week; payment, beyond the basic 40 hours, is at 38 per cent of the normal wage &dash. less than a cleaner's. 
There is no pay at all after the contracted hour; night duty has been rendered far more intensive because of the recent changes the Ministry has <tag "506429">sanctioned</>.

PROTESTS against the Bush Administration's initial responses to the repression in Beijing are starting to come from US exporters &dash. who claim that the White House initiatives were ill-planned, and are having unpredictable and contrary effects &dash. and also from angry Chinese students. 
The White House's China policy has already come under fire from Congress, which complains that President Bush's response was too feeble, and whose lower house last week passed a much tougher <tag "506385">sanctions</> bill which would freeze all US Government involvement in trade with China.   

800062
Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, used Commons questions yesterday to compare the friction between Mr Lawson and Sir Alan with the Prime Minister's perceived undermining of John Major at the Commonwealth conference in Kuala Lumpur. 
It was widely reported that Mrs Thatcher issued her objections to an agreed communique on <tag "506385">sanctions</> against South Africa on Mr Powell's advice, without first consulting her Foreign Secretary.  

800063
For Labour in opposition, South Africa has been a nice, easy issue. 
On the brink of possible power, Mr Kinnock continues to keep it easy by saying he will do whatever the ANC wants him to do: ie stick with <tag "506385">sanctions</>.

People from the Tetsworth area, claiming that their communities will be overwhelmed by the 100-acre development, confronted the inquiry inspector Mr Gordon Cummings and government representatives.

The Labour Party course has been deliberately misrepresented both by the government and by much of the press.

Yet, as he bows out next Sunday, Sir Shridath makes a remarkable claim. 
Her strident opposition to sanctions has helped the anti-apartheid cause he so passionately espouses. 
`The fact that Mrs Thatcher opposed <tag "506385">sanctions</> forced her to be more activist towards South Africa.  

800077
Parliament will continue discussing the suspension today. 
THE European Community, in a significant softening of its position, yesterday praised South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk for his reforms, and said sanctions could be gradually relaxed. 
True to her instincts, Mrs Thatcher, who has campaigned for the easing of international <tag "506385">sanctions</> against South Africa, emerged from the conference table to insist that she had won her battle for `the principle of a gradual relaxation of sanctions". 

800078
This practice, which is highly controlled in Islam by rules and restrictions, is accepted only in times of religious war.

This centers precisely on the area where they are supposed to be most at danger and to have their own choices determined by others &dash. namely, sexuality and marriage and group relations through women. 
There are two main aspects here: the <tag "506429">sanctioning</> of morally dubious behavior and a significant degree of influence over marriage patterns and therefore links between groups.   

800080
If we add that social interaction between the strata was cast very rigidly in terms of relative status and power, we can see just how complete the definition of social life is. 
It appears to me that this degree of ideological and social closure and control and the directness of the workings of power and <tag "506644">sanctions</> explain the absence of the problematic force of baraka, which is so important in our other example.   

800081
The Association of Professionals (ATP), which has taken control of the circuit from next year, labelled the event an inflated exhibition intended to undermine its own eight-man Tour Finals, to be held in Frankfurt three weeks earlier. 
And the West German Federation protested that it had not been consulted. 
A statement from the West German Federation yesterday took the matter a stage further, although the views expressed may not have been unanimous: `The tournament directors of the following ATP Tour events &dash.
