However, most of us are aware of some of our horse's efforts to communicate, and if we reward these efforts by understanding, the horse will gradually increase its communication with us. 
We can improve our ability to understand our horse if we can gradually train ourselves to observe it more intently, and to see in what situations and in what context different sounds, movements, and <tag "512740">behaviour</> are used.

Nor will it come as any surprise to close observers of these battles to find local branches of the Transport Workers' union swinging more arms than a demented octopus.

This has been a powerful force for good, he believes (though just at this moment it is none too helpful for the trade balance). 
But will the elimination of national level cartels now under way in Europe be replaced by a re-emergence of anti-competitive <tag "512740">behaviour</> on a European or wider level?

Both the oceanic and the continental crust are separated from the  underlying mantle by a sort of boundary, or discontinuity, known after its  Yugoslavian discoverer as the Mohorovicic discontinuity, or Moho for short. 
This discontinuity was recognized by studying the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of shock-waves  from earthquakes: above the Moho, shock waves travel relatively slowly;  below it, in the denser rocks of the mantle, they travel much faster. 

800005
It is easy to focus too much on the technology of information systems. 
To be an effective participant in the development and use of an MIS, a manager must know something about such matters as the principal functional activities within the organization (marketing, manufacturing, etc.), organizational structure, measurement and reporting systems, planning and control systems, organizational <tag "512740">behavior</>, and incentives.

This indicates that a rhythmic environment is not needed, but a possible effect from the rhythmic social and suckling influences of the mother has not been excluded.

Another junk bond, another town. 
THE MERCHANT banking subsidiary of National Westminster, Britain's biggest high street banking group, is expected to be criticised this week by a government report into Blue Arrow's controversial takeover of Manpower in 1987. 
But the Department of Trade and Industry is thought to have decided that the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of Blue Arrow and its financial advisers, including County Nat West, was not criminal.

I emphasized the tolerant person's view that in being tolerant he is restraining an inclination which is in itself desirable. 
The typical cases are those in which the intolerant inclination is in itself desirable because it is a reaction to wrongful <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

The City yesterday was stunned, and it was right to be.

But her attitude, as to much of the war news they read in the newspapers, is frankly sceptical: `Sunday December 20th.

David Evans (C. Welwyn and Hatfield) said the report on discipline in schools by Lord Elton last year had not gone far enough and should have recommended the reintroduction of corporal punishment. 
Mr Evans was called to order by the Speaker, Bernard Weatherill, when he tried to suggest that the Labour MP Dave Nellist should be given corporal punishment for his recent <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the Commons.

Hitler could no longer remain aloof from the `Jewish Question". 
In his address to the assembled Reichstag at the Nuremberg Party Rally on 15 September 1935, Hitler took up the `Jewish Question, in a major public speech for the first time since becoming Reich Chancellor, recommending acceptance ofthe three laws placed before it &dash. the `Flag law" and the two notorious anti-Jewish `Nuremberg Laws" (the Reich Citizenship Law, preventing Jews from becoming citizens of the Reich, and the `Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour", banning marriage and sexual relations between Jews and `aryans"). 
As in 1933, he accused the Jews abroad of stirring up agitation and boycotts against Germany, and claimed that this had made an impact on Jews inside Germany itself, whose public provocative <tag "512740">behaviour</> had stirred up countless complaints and calls for action by the government.

The two other sisters, Miranda and Janet, go radically different ways; Janet becomes a Tory, while Miranda grows up to be a very conscious feminist. 
It isn't giving away much of the story to say that Miranda at first sees her mother's <tag "512740">behaviour</> &dash. alternately doing everything she can to please her husband and then screaming rage at him for letting her down &dash. as a clear example of women's oppression.

Beyond indicating that Dicks would be fined, Macari was not prepared to comment on his attitude to discipline, but he shares the view of Howard Wilkinson of Leeds United, who said after his team's fractious match at Upton Park last month that it was impossible for managers to control the actions of their players from the dug-out. 
Nottingham Forest are the best behaved team in the League.

Sometimes these less aggressive horses can behave very unexpectedly and take us by surprise. 
We may take a mild-mannered horse, one that is bottom of the pecking order at home, out to ride in the company of others &dash. perhaps at a show or on a trail ride &dash. and find to our embarrassment that it is threatening to kick every horse in sight. 
Such <tag "512740">behaviour</> is a reaction to fear, of anticipating being hurt by another horse, especially if some other  rider comes up from behind.

Lord Olivier died on July 11, aged 82. 
THE FLUCTUATING fortunes of a baroness culminated in the death of her former husband after a wrangle over a country mansion that was her greatest asset, Worcester crown court heard yesterday. 
Mr Anthony Palmer, QC, prosecuting, said Baroness Susan de Stempel, aged 55, who denies murder, had wanted to sell Hopton House at Hopton Heath, near Craven Arms, Shropshire, after divorcing her husband, Mr Simon Dale, aged 68, in 1973 for unreasonable <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

It is the foundation of the canteen culture of racist and sexist attitudes. 
The fact that demotion to the ranks is a punishment for disciplinary offences or poor <tag "512740">behaviour</> heavily underlines both the kind of people found there and the attitude to them among the rest of the force.

And yes, beneath that hard exterior, his wife thinks he is a big softie.

They included `the creative arts, non-violent sports, making friends and nurturing a positive attitude to life and health, helping and encouraging others, walking her dogs and play-centred learning". 
The 49-year-old Mayoress's `play-centred learning process" now includes recognition that if you are found guilty of threatening and disorderly <tag "512740">behaviour</> after throwing a cup of tea at a gas worker and brandishing a sharp kitchen knife, saying, `I like sweetbreads for breakfast" (claimed by the gas worker to be, `I'll cut your balls off") you are likely to be #440 worse off from fines and costs.

No doubt, if challenged about his <tag "512740">behaviour</>, he would say that he was `only teasing", or that Mr Clarke was `just a bit of fluff" or he `liked it really" or `he was asking for it" by coming to the Commons with a skimpy statement.

It is not only stability in what was his Eastern European empire which concerns Mr Gorbachev but the stability also of what remains his Russian empire.

A relatively stiff ski will give more precise control; a light one (and particularly one with light tip and tail) will be easier to turn quickly, but will be less stable in a fast schuss; a pronounced side-cut will encourage turning.

In his letter, Mr Tony Hearn, of the Broadcasting and Entertaining Trades Alliance (Beta), said: `I find it impossible to understand how anyone who claims to support the Labour movement can act in this way." 
The general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Mr Ken Cameron, wrote: `With your publications the Daily and Sunday Mirror calling for justice for ambulance workers and others being denied rights by their employers, it is hypocritical of you to be instituting the industrial relations of the 1920s and 1930s."

In 1939, the Institute of Women's Professional Relations still supported segregated work roles, emphasizing that `women must be directed into occupations for which they are [peculiarly] adapted". 
As late as 1969 Dr. Benjamin Spock was saying that `if they [women] had careers in medicine or architecture, for instance, they should be able to make distinctly feminine contributions to the advancement of these fields, rather than compete with men in the usual manly tradition of these profession's (Decent and Undecent: Our Personal and Political <tag "512740">Behavior</> (New York, 1969), p.

Emphasis should be &dash. and surely was intended to be &dash. on the fact of breakdown, and not on the formal technicalities of establishing such breakdown. 
Adultery in effect is evidence of breakdown because it represents conduct, on the plane of sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</>, which is outrageous and offensive to the other partner.

However, if you keep  trying with the plan we outline, you will certainly succeed.

As Michael Keating points out in a recent report for Environment Canada, `statements of intent are the necessary precursors to action". 
But the head of that same agency, Minister of the Environment Lucien Bouchard, made a more telling point in his October 1989 speech to the UN General Assembly: `While speeches and rhetoric are important, and may often be powerful and moving, their value is limited if words do not result in concrete changes to our political and economic <tag "512740">behaviour</>."

But in other west European countries a different conclusion is being drawn, namely that European political union, perhaps excluding Britain, is all the more important so as to provide a check on American behaviour, to avoid a unipolar world. 
In particular, in Spain, Italy and also Germany, there is much discussion about a Mediterranean CSCE (Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, better known as the Helsinki process) a long-term institutionalised process of dialogue and negotiation about all the problems of the region, which is seen as an alternative to Hurd's Gulf Co-operation Council.

Those points you'll find again summed up in a hand-out which is at the back on the seats there. 
There is a hand-out on professional telephone <tag "512740">behaviour</>, a hand-out on the pleas from the switchboard supervisor, and also a form, a course form, if you could take that with you fill it in and let me have it back sometime.

That is, one needs the literate ability to express oneself clearly; but one also needs the right voice and the ability to be concise.

She had no reason to believe that Phoebe was bound to the house by a mysterious invisible cord, any more than she herself was, but, superstitiously, she could not take the risk. 
This sense ofbeing trapped by Phoebe's irresponsible and stupid <tag "512740">behaviour</>, this sense of being at Phoebe's mercy while Phoebe had no mercy on her, made her feel angry and punitive; and that made her feel guilty and ashamed; and that made her feel lonely and unloved.

The open discussion of these issues in Africa is difficult, since they reach into the heart of political life. 
Furthermore, their policy implications may be quite limited since they define the environment, and condition people's <tag "512740">behaviour</> within it, but are frequently outside the area of influence of planners, civil servants and aid-donors.

Let us take  an example of someone who is now thirty-five years old and  who has been somewhat overweight, say between 15 and  30 lb, for at least ten years. 
Any diet that takes this weight off  in a month or two will probably not be successful in the long  term. 
Unless the dieter permanently modifies his or her eating  <tag "512740">behaviour</>, any weight lost is likely to be regained.

They are very often blamed. 
When they are quite innocent of certain events they are unfortunately blamed by the public in those areas, and they are seen as damaging the countryside and they are seen &ellip. also they do not encourage the matter when you envisage the fact that they have these {vocal sound="um"}, for instance, animals &dash. the dogs around their sites which are not noted for their <tag "512740">behaviour</>, and there are many aspects of their behaviour which upset people around.

800071
Some link with the doctrine of the matrimonial offence has been retained by the further provision that the court may not decide that a marriage has broken down irretrievably unless the petitioner can establish one or more of the five following circumstances: 
that the respondent has committed adultery, and the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent; (2) that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him (or her); (3) that the respondent has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of at least two years preceding the presentation of the petition; (4) that the parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition, and the respondent consents to a decree being granted; or (5) that the parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least five years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. 
The <tag "512740">behaviour</> alleged under (1)-(3) above would amount to a matrimonial offence, while the circumstances covered by (4) amount to the first recognition in England of a right of divorce by mutual consent.

None of the commonly recognized virtues and morally significant forms of excellence consists in discharging one's duties or being disposed to do so. 
Honesty is a virtue which is particularly closely tied to the duty not to deceive, and yet even it is not exhausted by compliance with the duty.

And I think all the time what the leaflet does is give options, it's never directoral and never goes, never sort of overstates, it's just giving a range of options.

800078
I would use those meetings then to refine my ideas. 
From the viewpoint of this being an objective experiment, I would be a little bit worried about everyone knowing the nature of the experiment you had in mind because, as you probably know, in industrial studies there's a well known effect, I think it's called the Hawthorne effect, which merely by studying a group of people you change their <tag "512740">behaviour</> and their output simply because they know that you are taking an interest in them and they've got some idea of your expectations.

He was kind enough to assure me that he did not think me `a bad actor".

This level of commitment has produced a database of some complexity from which, at last, we can begin to understand something of the systems at work in Iron Age society. 
There have been a lot of surprises, not least the intricacy of the burial <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the community, which involved a range of propitiatory acts resulting in burial deposits often placed on the bottom of large disused storage pits.

But the crude over-emphases jostle with touches of true subtlety. 
In the course of the drama, Gwen Watford's venerable Countess seems to get perceptibly older, whiter-haired and stiffer in the joints, as though her son's <tag "512740">behaviour</> towards Helena and the news of his other derelictions has slackened her hold on life.

To avenge his pride, Zhivkov is supposed to have secretly fattened up some captive bears in the Rila Mountain Range, even going as far as putting them on steroids to give them some added heft. 
Because he was such a stickler for sporting <tag "512740">behaviour</>, he was not prepared simply to shoot the poor beasts in captivity. 

800085
It should note that in Australia, New Zealand and US states, such as California, where conciliation is successful in defusing post-divorce battles and, in a small number of cases, reconciling estranged couples, divorce based on fault has been scrapped. 
In Britain, the belief still lingers that making divorce less nasty equals making it easier. 
But a study by social policy researchers from Bristol University reveals how the present combination of quick divorce based on <tag "512740">behaviour</> or adultery and legal aid penny-pinching conspire to rush disenchanted spouses juggernaut-like along the path to a divorce decree. 

800086
The rating system was corrupt; they said they were protecting the family unit and thus you got `X" if you suck a tit and `GP" if you cut it off with a sword." 
Columbia fought the rating by hiring a major law firm and produced several hundred affidavits from psychiatrists, social experts and church men to support their view that the film should be seen by audiences under eighteen, because it was a realistic look at social <tag "512740">behaviour</>.   

800087
Someone has already taught it to be aggressive towards people: they  have reinforced a natural tendency for aggression and its expression. 
And bad habits are very hard to undo. 
The horse's <tag "512740">behaviour</> may be modified by trying to get it to have confidence in us and to like us; and by keeping our  own aggression under control, so that we don't arouse the horse's aggressive instinct.   

800088
Brenda Hogget QC, one of the five commissioners involved in the Family Law Report, says that the current legislation is confusing and dishonest. 
It pretends that there's single no-fault ground for divorce &dash. that the marriage has irretrievably broken down &dash. but in practice it encourages nearly three-quarters of divorcing couples to rely on fault based grounds &dash. adultery, or unreasonable <tag "512740">behaviour</> as it's usually called &dash. and then makes it difficult for anybody to defend allegations, irrespective of whether that was the real reason why the marriage broke down.   

800089
That was the decision of Abingdon magistrates yesterday when they refused to take the case of Ronald Charles Wood because of the serious nature of the alleged attack. 
Wood, 47, now living at Oxford Crescent, Didcot, is charged with assaulting Mary Wood between June 1 and 3 at the former marital home in Frilsham Street, Sutton Courtenay, and causing her actual bodily harm. 
He is also accused of using abusive and violent <tag "512740">behaviour</> in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace on June 3. 

800090
Especially now." 
`Now" meant the return of Manchester United (as FA Cup winners) to the European Cup Winners" Cup, and of Aston Villa (as League runners-up) to the Uefa Cup, in a move which many in the game yesterday welcomed as an injection of fresh impetus and new hope to English football, given a leg up by the achievements of the national team and the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of their supporters during the World Cup.   

800091
Dr Lagrange explained that the French government's advertising campaigns were pragmatic and non-moralistic. 
With a Gallic shrug, he says: `People have the <tag "512740">behaviour</> they have &dash. how do we make the behaviour safe and practical?"   

800092
Such middle-aged decisiveness can be brought on by existential unrest. 
One little puzzling aspect about Mr Lawson's <tag "512740">behaviour</> last Thursday was that on the Wednesday he had had a good day, as ministerial days go.   

800093
Saturday is the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence, and human rights groups will probably be on the streets, despite government threats to punish demonstrators. 
MORALE of US forces in Panama, damaged by the failure of this month's coup attempt against General Manuel Noriega, has plunged further because of the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the new Commander-in-Chief, General Maxwell Thurman, known to his men as `Mad Max".   

800094
That's just life." 
But the R&and.A remarked on it during the presentation, about the unsporting <tag "512740">behaviour</> of some sections of the crowd, and it was an unsavoury ending to a great day for me.

But Burrows counters: `Children need the security of knowing they have a mother who is bigger and stronger than they are, who is in control." 
Child psychiatrist Dr John Pearce, author of a number of books about the role of parents, including the recently published Bad Behaviour, is one expert who tries to tread the middle ground. 
While accepting that smacking is universal, he believes there are better methods of teaching children what is acceptable or unacceptable <tag "512740">behaviour</>.   

800096
He recommended a one-year trial period for English clubs in European competition. 
He said: `I have been heartened by the exemplary <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the England players, who won the Fair Play award, and of those thousands of English supporters who contributed to a relatively peaceful World Cup."

If you live near the home base of an orchestra and would like to be involved contact Dr Ian James, Royal Free Hospital, London NW3 2QG. 
`Death Wish" was the nickname given to a young man by his friends because he indulged in dangerous and foolhardy <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Moynihan also reviews the 1989-90 domestic season and concludes that while attendances rose by 5.4 per cent (up nearly a million to 19.3 million), the police report that arrests fell by 240 to 5,945 and ejections from grounds were down by 634 to 6,973. 
Both Manchester United and Aston Villa had better-than-average records. 
`The overall improvement in <tag "512740">behaviour</> within grounds in recent seasons has been maintained," the report says. 

800099
Evans also admitted assaulting Mr Garry Richardson in Ambrosden. 
Evans also pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage to a bus shelter and placing a lit firework through the letter box of a police house in Ambrosden. 
A charge of using disorderly <tag "512740">behaviour</> towards an MoD police officer and a charge of stealing a vehicle excise licence were also admitted by Evans.

The question is whether road pricing is the best response to the problem, since it focuses on just one aspect &dash. inadequate road space in central areas &dash. as if road congestion and delay were the primary issues to resolve. 
But the inordinately high volumes of traffic, forecast to rise substantially, bring in their wake a much wider range of adverse consequences. 
First and foremost are road accidents and the impact of the risk of accidents &dash. the two are not synonymous &dash. on the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of other road users such as the elderly and children. 

800101
Educated Turks especially, heirs to the militant secularism of Kemal Ataturk, are shocked to find their European identity judged by religious criteria. 
Yet the success of Ataturk's revolution looks far less certain today than it did a generation ago: almost every day brings new evidence of the strength of Islam in Turkey, not as a set of private religious beliefs but as a public phenomenon, moulding people's <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the political and social arena. 

800102
MR JUSTICE SCHIEMANN said that the result of the girl's autistic tendecies was that the significance of the plaintiff's stick and of her friendly features would not have penetrated. 
There was no evidence to indicate that her <tag "512740">behaviour</> when out on walks was significantly more physically disturbing of the rest of mankind than would be the case with a normal adolescent.   

800103
We value their spontaneity, their instinctive, non-reflective immediacy. 
Furthermore, often when the goal concerns interaction between people, its very possibility depends on the partners having correct expectations concerning the meaning of other people's <tag "512740">behaviour</>.   

800104
The shift was not wholly imposed from the outside. 
The two modes fight it out in Schlesinger's Billy Liar, where the hero escapes from the constraints of life in an undertaking business by fantasizing himself as variously a soldier, Winston Churchill, a gunman mowing down his family or an aristocrat living with obliging parents whose <tag "512740">behaviour</> is strikingly different from that of the real screeching proletarians.   

800105
Gonorrhoea is almost exclusively acquired sexually. 
That is to say, as a result of sexual intercourse or one of the variants of sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</>, such as fellatio, cunnilingus, or rectal intercourse.   

800106
He had doubted her loyalty, believing a titbit of gossip Conroy had dropped. 
His <tag "512740">behaviour</> towards his girlfriend had reflected that, and now he had discovered that Conroy had been malicious.   

800107
Socialism would develop in many forms, as socialist countries `one after the other" crossed the line from which there was no return to the past. 
At so delicate a juncture `clumsy <tag "512740">behaviour</> or provocative statements" could not be allowed to endanger the historic changes in progress.

`Are you serious?" 
`No, but it would explain months of odd <tag "512740">behaviour</> by Gerrard.

Yet East Sussex is a Conservative education authority, and on this political persecution of its teachers the Conservative Government remains silent. 
If East Sussex were a Labour authority, however, can anyone doubt the lengths to which the Government's spin doctors and their media friends would go in denouncing such tyrannical <tag "512740">behaviour</>? 

800110
For their part, the Muslims had already given up their claim to reunion with Syria as their price for participation in government under the Covenant. 
But whenever the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of either Christians or Muslims was to be challenged in the future, the Covenant itself would inevitably be called into question.

An unidentified Chinese had called him and said: `I'd like to warn you that although this is a so-called free country, you are not free. 
You'd better watch your <tag "512740">behaviour</>."

THE West Midlands manual suggests themes a detective can use to obtain a first admission of guilt. 
These concentrate on getting the suspect to admit a minimal involvement `the initial breakthrough that can be built on later." 
Detectives are told to put forward reasons or excuses for the suspect's <tag "512740">behaviour</> and minimise the moral seriousness of the crime.   

800113
But if that is how I, a stranger, a non-Jew born a year after Hitler's death could think &dash. even briefly &dash. then how is one even to question the  survivors or their children? 
Or, more importantly, how is one to approach the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the state which was forged &dash. as many of its citizens will tell you &dash. in the very fires of Auschwitz?   

800114
I'm a single parent, and I blame myself for the way he is &dash. but I feel it's too late to get through to him now as talking or reasoning doesn't work. 
I'm pretty sure you're going to need some help to deal with your son's <tag "512740">behaviour</>, and his problems at school.

Ellis responds to an attempted seduction by Blakely's friend Cliff with an allusion to her lover's potential for violence. 
The Chanel suit worn by Ellis marks her out as distinctly as her <tag "512740">behaviour</> from Blakely's more socially elevated associates, particularly his potential fiance&acute.e, `a nice-looking, well-brought-up, well-groomed young woman, discreetly pretty, and dressed out of Burberry's and Jaeger with a bit of Hermes thrown in."

Respect did not prevent children from rebelling against their parents. 
And the grave, sober image of old age was a constraint on social <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

They assaulted a number of people in Witney's Market Square for `no apparent reason," the town's magistrates were told yesterday (Fri). 
The two pleaded guilty to charges of assault and threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</> at a previous hearing which was adjourned for reports.   

800118
I take the law to be that someone mentally unfit may not necessarily be incapable of reaching a rational decision as regards further treatment. 
It would depend both on his precise mental state, whether he was capable of lucid moments at the particular time, and the particular treatment involved; for instance, refusal of therapeutic drugs prescribed to control dangerous <tag "512740">behaviour</> would not be regarded in the same light as refusal to have a tooth extracted.   

800119
The theme for this Focus is religious education and assemblies: From their very first day in school, children are encouraged to be considerate, to live together amicably and to have respect for others and for their surroundings. 
Indeed, many come into school from playgroups and nurseries where sharing belongings and helping each other are taken for granted &dash. `do as you would be done by" and `turn the other cheek" &dash. are symbolic phrases for the sort of <tag "512740">behaviour</> we would like to think our offspring perform, rather than the smash-and-grab antics we suspect they resort to occasionally. 

800120
The male can weigh up to 130lbs and grow to 28 inches at the shoulder. 
The breed has already received bad publicity after Charlene Ogden, four, suffered head injuries when she was attacked while playing near her home in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear. 
Mr Fisher, who bought an akita to study its <tag "512740">behaviour</>, said: `They are a very difficult breed to handle and are very powerful."   

800121
Strangely, lesbians have come to be categorised as a `low risk group" for HIV infection. 
At least our sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> (as defined by who, we need to ask) has been classified as low risk &dash. though this appears to have been interpreted by every corner of society as no risk.   

800122
What on earth did Jack think he was playing at? 
His <tag "512740">behaviour</> during that summer was exuberant and strange.   

800123
The reason for this is clearly indicated in the text, as Friedrich Solmsen has shown in an important article; Eteocles is in the power of the Erinys. 
In Agamemnon's case the evidence of the text is less positive; but I have little doubt that Gundert is right in thinking that the reason for his <tag "512740">behaviour</> is the same. 

800124
After this, a CAA Surveyor was to be asked to inspect the modifications to determine whether the CAA would categorise them as Minor or a Major Modifications and to establish the details of the flight testing required. 
The effect of the drag reduction kit modifications on the aircraft's pre- and post-stall <tag "512741">behaviour</> could not be documented precisely but it is unlikely that their effect on the stall speed and characteristics would have been significant.  

800125
Whether they ever really did come to believe their own propaganda or not, it all appears now quite fatuous. 
For all practical purposes, whatever the statute books say, the ANC is unbanned for the first time since 1960, its supporters out of the woodwork with a vengeance &dash. or rather not with a vengeance, but with a remarkable reservoir of peace in their hearts, as the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the 60,000-plus crowd at Soweto's Soccer City stadium demonstrated.  

800126
Thus there would be no gap left to be filled later by another disease-transmitting strain. 
Dr Crampton's group is studying several genes that might be fed into the wild population. 
One of them sets the rhythm for the mosquito's daily <tag "512740">behaviour</> and controls the beat of its mating song. 

800127
Dylan Jones treads a fine line in Jim Morrison: Dark Star (Bloomsbury, #16.99). 
The more inglorious aspects of Morrison's life and <tag "512740">behaviour</>, and the undignified myth-making indulged in by his `followers" aren't concealed, but then Jones doesn't exactly run the hoary old rock conceit of romantic self-destruction out of town either: `Humility was a trait which didn't sit well with Morrison" is about as heavy as the criticism gets.   

800128
Michael Lewis is a street-smart young American who made a fortune as a bond salesman with Salomon Brothers before leaving last year &dash. still in his twenties &dash. to become a full-time writer. 
As a parting gift, this brutal expose of the personal and corporate excesses of his former employers must rank as one of the truly great acts of ingratitude in Wall Street's history. 
Not that one gets the impression that the traders on the 41st floor at Salomon Brothers' New York head office will see anything particularly surprising or deplorable about Lewis's <tag "512740">behaviour</>. 

800129
Neutrality is possible in some cases, but it may be impossible in others. 
A second argument designed to show that neutrality is chimerical claims that whether or not a person acts neutrally depends on the base line relative to which his <tag "512740">behaviour</> is judged, and that there are always different base lines leading to conflicting judgments and no rational grounds to prefer one to the others.   

800130
Oxford University Student Union was involved in organising the demonstration along with the Pergamon NUJ because we condemn the way Maxwell has trampled over worker and trade union rights at Pergamon Press. 
No demonstrator at any time intended or attempted to curtail Maxwell's right to free speech by preventing him from speaking at the Union; we merely wished to exercise our right to free speech by demonstrating our opposition to his <tag "512740">behaviour</>. 

800131
There can be no mercy for Arsenal and Norwich, whose players took part in the first of three brawls on London grounds within 19 days. 
Token fines and warnings would undermine the leadership shown by Graham Kelly, the FA's chief executive, when within 48 hours of the Highbury incident he announced the decision to charge the clubs not only with bringing the game into disrepute but with failing to control the `violent, threatening &ellip. or provocative <tag "512740">behaviour</>" (in short, hooliganism) of their employees.   

800132
As a result there is no remedy available to an aggrieved party if a tribunal's decision is not complied with &dash. unless the statute should expressly create such a remedy. 
This was not done in the 1985 Act &dash. with the result that it would be open to the Government not to comply with an order if it takes the view that the Tribunal's decision clearly exceeds its powers under the statute. 
It is to be noted further that the Act, no doubt inadvertently, facilitates such <tag "512740">behaviour</> by providing that the Tribunal shall give reasons for its decisions only to the Prime Minister.   

800133
Is there not something seriously wrong when Civil Servants who do the wrong thing &dash. such as those involved in the Barlow Clowes affair &dash. go unnamed and apparently undisciplined, while those who do the right thing &dash. such as Clive Ponting &dash. are disciplined in a blaze of publicity? 
The norms of good <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the Civil Service appear to be diametrically opposed to the public interest.   

800134
But he points to sub-Sarahan Africa where HIV infection has probably been spreading since the late 1960s: only in the last few years have infection levels in the general population risen to 10 per cent or more, in certain countries. 
Until surveys on sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> and anonymised blood testing are completed, the true number carrying the virus &dash. and reliable calculations on how it will continue to spread in Britain &dash. will not be known.  

800135
Losing 10-2 at home to Bramley, they recovered to win 42-10. 
Batley's stand-off Simon Wilson suffered a severe neck injury in the last moments of his side's game at Whitehaven and was detained overnight in West Cumberland Hospital. 
IF re-entry to Europe was tested on footballing merit rather than fan <tag "512740">behaviour</>, then a few Uefa heads might be shaking disapprovingly over the English credentials presented at Highbury.

There's never been any suggestion that he was criminally liable, but such a man should not be president of a free country, even less Secretary-General of the UN." 
Dr Waldheim said: `It fills me with satisfaction that, on the basis of a fair and objective investigation, what I have always said has been proved true: that I am not burdened with any guilty <tag "512740">behaviour</>." 

800138
I mean many of our students are doing nothing different to what students at other universities do when they go and have a private party in their lodgings. 
But I think one of the big differences with Oxford is that a very, very high proportion of students are living in college and so they're <tag "512740">behaviour</> is visible to college.

Lead can affect sperm and exposure to the metal can cause learning difficulties and loss of impulse control, common in delinquents. 
Derek Bryce-Smith, professor of chemistry at Reading University and scientific advisor to SCASO, insists that diet and <tag "512740">behaviour</> are linked.   

800140
In short, although deflation will inescapably make consumers worse off, devaluation could insulate producers, so that the gloom in the high street does not spread to the factory floor. 
This beguiling, if old-fashioned, argument receives some support from the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of exports in recent years.   

800141
After a few years' disgrace they were back living quietly but comfortably in Moscow. 
Perhaps it was a reversion to humane <tag "512740">behaviour</> after Stalin's terror techniques.

James Lovelock, author of the Gaia Hypothesis, will run the first course, lasting five weeks and costing #1,080. 
Lovelock, who postulated that the earth behaves like a living organism, says his course will `consider further the states of health and disease of the earth and provide an opportunity to interact with computer models which demonstrate how Gaia has responded to problems and catastrophes and shed light on the consequences of present human <tag "512740">behaviour</>."

He did not loosen his links with the athletes when projected upwards into the Presidency. 
Provided their <tag "512740">behaviour</> was sportsmanlike and safe, oarsmen found only encouragement and humour from a President who was always among them.   

800144
Indeed the recent evidence on plasmids can be seen as beautiful supporting evidence for the conjectures near bottom of page 182 (which seemed a bit wild at the time). 
From some points of view it does not really matter whether these fragments originated as invading parasites or breakaway rebels. 
Their likely <tag "512740">behaviour</> will be the same.   

800145
Toby, on his part, avoided Michael, while being obviously extremely aware of him. 
Michael guessed on general grounds, and then read in the boy's <tag "512740">behaviour</>, that a reaction had set in. 

800146
Governments and political parties need to come to terms with the fact that a national economic policy &dash. around which most political debate is still conducted &dash. is increasingly an irrelevance, incapable of being enforced even if it can be agreed. 
Drucker has fun highlighting the paradoxes of 1980s economic <tag "512740 or 512741">behaviour</> &dash. how the dollar's fall and the yen's revaluation, for example, have had almost exactly opposite effects to those predicted by conventional economics.

`When asked about sexual harassment, most male managers will say they are not harassed enough. 
They need to know that some <tag "512740">behaviour</> women find anything but flattering."

She's had help now, but what a pity, you know, then I guess people weren't so aware of what could be done, but what a pity she couldn't have had help at the time. 
Yes, I think it's &ellip. just to follow on from that {vocal sound="um"} about trusting children to &ellip. to give us the sort of clues that we need to be able to respond to, very often they do that in ways that are not directly associated perhaps with the anxiety that's around, so that they may be expressing their anxiety by just generally difficult <tag "512740">behaviour</> or by wetting the bed at night, or maybe being quite disruptive in their play, or provoking other children, and adults who are able to see that sort of behaviour as useful for information for us, so that we can respond appropriately, not out of anger and a {vocal sound="um"} judgemental sort of response, but in a way that we can support their anxiety by &ellip. by not getting over excited and + and {vocal sound="um"} responding in a very aggressive way to the very aggression that they're expressing as a result of their anxiety.   

800149
False accusations were in the air. 
The Independent carried the words `Dr Waldheim cleared of involvement in commando deaths" without attributing the Austrian president's presumed innocence to the Ministry of Defence in the headline. 
`It fills me with satisfaction," Dr Waldheim was quoted as saying later, `that, on the basis of a fair and objective investigation, what I have always said has been proved true: that I am not burdened with any guilty <tag "512740">behaviour</>."   

800150
Nigel Spackman, bought from Queen's Park Rangers last week added steel to the midfield, the crucial area for Rangers. 
Graeme Souness has tried to instil in his team the need to abandon the traditional Scottish terrier approach in favour of a more relaxed style and Rangers certainly wove some pretty patterns, Trevor Steven again demonstrating his return to form and scoring the winning goal. 
Not so attractive was the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of Mark Walters, dismissed for an outrageous double assault on McPherson and John Colquhoun after an earlier booking.   

800151
It is important to realise that divine impassibility is an aspect of God's immutability, that God is utter perfection and completely self-sufficient and therefore cannot be subject to change. 
He is not subject to any action from without, action which could compel him to change His attitudes or <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Previously, you have done this, been rebuked or expelled &dash. an event described with differing spin in the next day's papers &dash. and given a justificatory interview to a television crew outside. 
In this way, the (often noble) motivation for your actions is aired on screen but the (often pathetic) mechanics of your protest are not. 
If certain to be recorded, such interruptions would need to be carefully judged and, accordingly, broadcasting might even improve <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Although it was especially developed for babies at risk of allergy, many nutritionists believe that it would benefit all babies to follow a similar, gradual pattern of weaning, If your family is not allergy prone, you can adapt it to suit your needs, circumstances and baby.

It is not necessary to try to change your mental characteristics directly, to somehow think  yourself better controlled. 
Concentrate instead on studying your own <tag "512740">behaviour</>, your interactions with your environment; by working on external factors in this way you will be able to work out practical strategies to succeed, and strong will-power will appear to come about automatically without you having to work on it directly.

Somehow, in the sexual experience I was making the woman into a sort of a mom &dash. an authoritarian female figure; that made me feel inadequate to the situation, small and childish. 
I indulged myself in a lot of masturbatory <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

These are the analogues of our own reproductive cells in our testes and ovaries. 
The sterile workers are the analogy of our liver, muscle, and nerve cells. 
Kamikaze <tag "512740">behaviour</> and other forms of altruism and cooperation by workers are not astonishing once we accept the fact that they are sterile.

But there are enough extraordinary facts and unusual insights in this book to make it essential reading for any layman who has ever wondered about the workings of our legal system.

Hytner admitted he was having problems with opera at the moment, but again he couldn't &dash. or wouldn't &dash. specify.

" Henry had always found romantic love a demeaning spectacle, and Rush seemed to exemplify the final stages of the disease. 
The ideal lover worshipped his or her partner without much reference to his or her <tag "512740">behaviour</>; the only way to get the love object to collaborate unquestioningly in the fantasy was to stop it moving, permanently.

This is of great advantage to good horse trainers, but a real bane to poor ones. 
A good horse trainer teaches a horse good habits so that it does what he wants it to do automatically, without it learning any undesirable behaviour or bad habits in the process; but a poor trainer often finds that his horses learn something unwanted at the same time. 
A  horse can learn desirable <tag "512740">behaviour</> in one lesson, but it can just as easily learn a bad habit.

The heroine, Pineapple Poll, who disguises herself as a sailor for love of handsome Captain Belaye, was turned into a younger and more attractive woman than is implied in the poem, and given an admirer of her own, Jasper, for a happy ending.

Kennan &dash. together with almost all Establishment opinion in the US &dash. simply never asked how the Soviet Union might analyse its security requirements. 
In consequence, there were simply no criteria for assessing whether brutal Soviet <tag "512740">behaviour</> in Eastern Europe implied aggressive intentions in Western Europe.

`So you can see there are more attractive horizons," commented Mr Lawrence. 
Mr Tony Taylor, chief Crown prosecutor in Greater Manchester, said that the service was having more success than the magistrates" courts in recruitment because of better pay and because a prosecutor's job offered the attraction of being a `player" rather than a `referee," as in the case of the court clerk.

A young horse that is reared without the company of others is likely to be socially inept with others as a mature horse: those reared on their own, such as orphan or solitary foals, are likely to learn inappropriate behaviour  for their species. 
Horses raised in isolation sometimes behave inappropriately towards potential sexual partners. 
Instead of `getting on with the job", as the horsemen say, a colt or stallion may respond to the mare with fear, aggression, or playfulness &dash. <tag "512740">behaviour</> which normal animals display  towards strange or novel objects.   

800173
Recently the press have, lf anything, tended to understate the extent of the problem to deny hooligans `the oxygen of publicity". 
The view that hooligans actually learn how to behave from the papers and reflect back to the public the image that has been created for them is not really borne out in personal interviews. 
Moreover, the nature of crowd <tag "512740">behaviour</> may be different from the past not just in style but in substance.

Thus the new State finds it necessary to accommodate precisely those processes which were one of the sources of the original movement of national liberation.

But in requiring statements to be subjected to a new test of `reliability," the law has saddled judges with a critical job for which they too have had no training.

There is only the free gift of the unseen powers to hope for, since the possibility for this social class of direct incorporation into other relations is so diminished. 
Contractual relations that are dependent on personal intention and promises of certain kinds of pious <tag "512740">behavior</> in return for some form of saintly baraka are one of the very few acts and contracts men can independently initiate.

The climax is the battle between `The Nasty" who damages buses &dash. a fearsome creature who had the three-year-olds clutching each other and climbing aboard their teachers &dash. and `Super Driver", a nicely sent up character in tights and a peaked cap. 
Amid much audience participation, `The Nasty" is defeated by a set of rules for good <tag "512740">behaviour</> on the bus, and, at the end, four-year-old Danielle came out to receive a `Precious Gem Award" for the school &dash. a big medal destined, said John Dobson, the head, to be the focus of a display of work about buses.

`The policeman done well," Andy Gray, the Palace player, said later. 
Bobby Campbell, the Chelsea manager, refused to comment with that tell-tale hint that criticism of referees brings punishment for managers.

The society also decided, at a council meeting last week, to compile, over the next three months, a dossier of cases of alleged misuse by government departments and ministers, to establish whether there is evidence to back up anecdotal claims that the integrity of government statistics is being undermined. 
Miron Straf, the director of the Committee on National Statistics in Washington, which monitors and reviews US government statistics, is to be invited to address the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) on how his organisation operates and how a similar group could be established in Britain. 
The decisions follow two recent cases over which the Government was widely criticised &dash. the Prime Minister's refusal to fund a survey of sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> to further research about the spread of Aids, and a report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies which showed that the Government's new way of counting people in the poorest category of the population had reduced the number by 1 million.

`I was trying to deal with the climate of the Fifties during which there was great disposition among Americans to trust their government," says Heller now. 
It is only against this background that one can begin now to understand the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of Hollywood and Broadway, of the star names who confessed so eagerly and abjectly to their previous sins and were meat and drink to the H.U.A.C.

While it is unquestionably a step in the right direction for such international teams to make recommendations as to optimal treatment schedules and ideal diagnostic facilities, it avails little if governments do not take their advice or if there is a shortage of money, personnel, or both. 
This appears, sadly, to be the situation in many countries, and suggestions like the one from the WHO document Social and health aspects of sexually transmitted disease (1977) that `it is essential for clinics to have the basic equipment required for making rapid diagnosis: the darkfield examination, a quick micro-flocculation test for syphilis, and smear and culture of specimens for gonorrhoea" are not much use to a health worker in a village in India, who, far from considering buying a microscope, cannot obtain the antibiotics needed to cure gonorrhoea had he the facilities for diagnosing it. 
However, even if governments were prepared to spend more of their gross national product on healthcare facilities, while the incidence of complications from the sexually transmitted diseases might decline, no amount of money would have a significant effect on the prevalence of these diseases unless it could be used to alter people's attitudes and <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Generally, therefore, we recommend that you  weigh yourself each day.

And in fact the university's health and safety committee has recently taken this up and is trying to run both some sort of investigation and, I think, and educational programme. 
There's been discussion about whether the problem of alcohol, and most people agree there is a problem, should be tackled primarily educationally or through disciplinary means. 
And I think that the argument has been that on the whole discipline &ellip. the use of discipline simply to punish drinking isn't going to be appropriate, although there may be forms of <tag "512740">behaviour</> produced by excessive drinking that it's appropriate to act against.

Certain teams did become very loosely identified with Catholic or Protestant support in Liverpool and Manchester, but this was never a prominent feature of English football or a significant source of violence. 
Tony Mason, who has weighed up both the composition and the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of Victorian and Edwardian football crowds as carefully as the sketchy evidence permits, suggests that skilled workers were disproportionately dominant within the crowd.

Dr James Birley, the president of Britain's Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that the society must `send (the Russians) a signal that we don't believe they have yet mended their ways". 
Dr Birley said he thought the political abuse of Soviet psychiatry was now `much more sporadic than systematic", but mainly because definitions of punishable <tag "512740">behaviour</> had changed under Mikhail Gorbachev.

The same team shows that WPP, while crippling itself by debt, threw away its crutches by taking on so many small earn-outs (over 30) that it risks, on this count alone, a 150% increase in share capital &dash. with awful implications for dividends. 
In taking new-fangled ideas to such excess, of course, WPP was by no means alone. 
The many variations of Gadarene <tag "512740">behaviour</> imply that the fault lies, not with the system, but those who operate within it: auditors, regulators, investors, commentators, but above all managers themselves.

The guidelines, which will be sent to every school and college in England and Wales, say that fit and competent group leaders are the most important factor to ensure the safety of children on school expeditions.

I think if anything it's more likely that what we'll have at Oxford is some extremely tough women, because these are women who have made their way through the educational system and are tough cookies.

His talent lay in supporting and encouraging his assistants in developing their own rather than his personal interests.

The foul that led to the penalty shot was `non-existent"." 
An article in the newspaper Cronica stated: `West Germany played better, but as it was not going to make a goal in 100 years, the referee gave them the game on his own, inventing a penalty and decimating Argentina by the expulsion of two players." 
Argentina are unlikely to face `spectacular" disciplinary action after their <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the World Cup final, say FIFA.

Briggs was used as an emergency no 9 for the Third Division game at Wigan and also for a Leyland Daf Cup game last month.

Behavior of the organization depends on the mutual relationships among its structure, planning and control processes, incentives, and measurement and reporting systems. 
As the `central nervous system" of the organization, the information system ties together these governance mechanisms. 
No fundamental improvements can come through information technology without considering the broader aspects of organizational <tag "512740">behavior</>.

I think, though, what's very important in that as well is that I know that there are young men in the colleges who are really ashamed of the sort of picture that's increasingly being presented. 
Whether that shame is yet moving them to have an impact on the men who they see perpetrating this sort of behaviour in colleges I don't know, but certainly some of the undergraduates I have spoken to feel very embarrassed that this is the portrait of male behaviour that's being perpetrated. 
Part of that picture that's coming out about the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of males in colleges has to do with alcohol.

The yardstick of legitimacy must never become the propensity to fail; if it does the streets may be used for other forms of protest by those who find all peaceful routes to change barred to them. 
If we turn to the new public order offences in sections 4 and 5 of the 1986 Act, we find that section 4 re-enacts in a more precise form the old `insulting behaviour" section under the 1936 Act which we have already discussed in an earlier part of this chapter. 
The concept of `unlawful violence" has replaced the vaguer notion of `breach of the peace" and the offending <tag "512740">behaviour</> required by the section has now to be directed at another person; it is not enough for the conduct to exist in a world of its own, as seemed to have been suggested by the case concerning the prosecution of the two male lovers, discussed above.

If there is not one in your block, you could organise one yourselves. 
It must be of concern to many occupiers of your flats that the value of their property is at risk because of the disreputable <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the few and they may be very glad to join with you in improving things.

The veerings of mood to which the characters are liable are both funny and disturbing.

Or even, at the limit, you will recognise them but try to adapt them so that they become manageable, liveable with. 
All this is as much a pleasure for the perceptive reader as for you, though for you it is the taxing pleasure, the internal gymnastics, of greater self-recognition; which you may or may not allow to affect your <tag "512740">behaviour</> from then on.

The very desire to seek extremes, to reveal taboos, to allow free range to imagination, implies the existence of repression. 
In the fifties, when the grey-suited corporation man, his corsetted wife right beside him, was so very anxious to conform to every social nicety, all thought of breaking out beyond highly defined rules of social behaviour was severely repressed. 
Artists expressed raw emotions and direct responses to experience at a time when the petit-bourgeois mentality of democratic capitalism stressed vigilant, prudent and measured <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Well, children can be allowed to express their anxieties verbally and to learn perhaps from the adults' modelling around them that to talk about these things in moderation is perfectly acceptable {vocal sound="um"} but not to do it to the extent or to allow children to perhaps watch the news coverage to the extent that they become over excited and are not able to contain their own feelings of anxiety about loss and damage and death and separation from parents and significant adults. 
But they are unable to process this and obviously that will be different for children at different stages of their development {vocal sound="um"} younger children being particularly susceptible to the sort of atmosphere around them, and if they are picking up from the adults around them, be that through the media or within the context of their everyday lives, that there is something dangerous and disturbing going on, then they are obviously going to reflect that unease in their <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

I'd like to just bring you back to the first question you asked, which was how do you define sexual harassment. 
I think it's a terribly difficult thing to do, but I'd like to have a go at it in the following way, by saying that somebody is &ellip. a case of sexual harassment has occurred when the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of one person makes another person uncomfortable in such a way that that person, the person who's uncomfortable, becomes overly conscious of their gender or sexual characteristics.

A spokesman, Mr Stewart Boyle, said: `Mrs Thatcher cannot claim to be a credible international leader if Britain is pumping out that much more CO2 at the beginning of the next century."

Gyre, one of two weakling twins, died, apparently of pneumonia, at 10 months, probably because his sick and partly paralysed mother didn't have enough milk. 
Flint survived infancy but never really grew beyond it, and was still unweaned at eight and dependent on his mother. 
His <tag "512740">behaviour</> was retarded, his testicles were small and one was still undescended, and he never became properly mature.

In many respects, rocks are like pitch, which flows like a liquid if it  is left unsupported for long enough, for example on a steeply-sloping  roof, but will also break suddenly along clean shiny fracture surfaces  if it is given a sharp blow. 
It was mentioned in chapter one that the rocks making up the Earth's  mantle show the same kind of <tag "512740">behaviour</> &dash. on a short time-scale, they are  rigid (`solid") enough to transmit shock waves from earthquakes, but on  a much longer time-scale, they can `flow", and accommodate the  convection movements which are believed to provide the driving  mechanisms behind Plate Tectonics.

Another election would be an even greater gamble for Mr Haughey than the last one.

Allowing &ellip. giving them time, I mean maybe this is what we should be, you know, hopefully we'd be doing this anyway, but just using &ellip. what we use in our family anyway to talk &ellip. to, you know, as them questions. 
If they come up with a question maybe just find out what's being it {vocal sound="um"} not just reaction to a particular <tag "512740">behaviour</>, but asking them how the feeling, you know &ellip. maybe pointing to the bit in their body that's actually feeling butterflies or whatever and trying to help them to express the fears and, more importantly, to make them concrete in terms of play, drawing, or acting it out.

Chadourne urged government censorship to correct the problem.

He called it the `English binge". 
It was a dinner held at his own expense in a private room at Magdalen, and it was a symptom of his great generosity.

There were many who lived the fast life like Ellis and didn't suffer her fate, but the question of what distinguished Ruth Ellis from others in her circle did not interest Newell or Delaney. 
The only scene in the film that focuses on the attitude of other women to Ruth's desperate liaison involves two hostesses chattering in the ladies' lavatory about their current conquests and Ellis's unseemly <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

The Muslim community in Bradford, where Yasmin comes from, is very strong, and there had recently been a case which made national news of two Muslim sisters fighting for their right to wear their headscarves to school. 
Many religions have codes of dress or <tag "512740">behaviour</> that particularly affect girls; some may seem restrictive, but Yasmin feels that covering herself is not repressive but liberating; her sense of finally feeling `right" is enormous.   

800244
I mean where do you think that line should be drawn? 
Well for my own part I think that one can educate students as far as possible in terms of what appropriate <tag "512740">behaviour</> is, and I think that you can police students with disciplinary measures when it's absolutely clear that when they know what the inappropriate behaviour is they nevertheless make a choice that they're going to move beyond those boundaries of appropriateness.

Mynes admitted assaulting Mr Gary Naylor on July 29 last year.

So as I say, those pleas are all on a hand-out, which you could please take with you when you go. 
As I say, there is a film for you to have a look at, we'll have a look at the film now, it's a Video Arts Film called `Professional Telephone <tag "512740">Behaviour</>", and it deals with the correct way to handle calls, as with all Video Arts, there are some rather funny little stories about ways not to deal with calls.   

800248
So that a large part of every day is not determined by thought at all, it more or less just happens because of habit. 
Horses are very much creatures of habit, too, but to an even greater degree; and like us, can form both good and bad habits. 
Good habits contribute to a horse's physical and psychological well-being; whereas bad habits frequently impair the horse's health or <tag "512740">behaviour</> in some way.

Beside his chair now there lay two new paperbacks, one an award-winning political biography he had been looking forward to getting hold of ever since it had first been announced and knew he would never read, the other a compilation of little-known and presumably wondrous facts from the worlds of history, biology and places like that. 
It was the mildly surprising <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the female bot-fly that he was reading about when the afternoon walk came round.

Both areas will be far below optimum today but &dash. and this is the important point &dash. in the one case the land can be brought back to full production easily, whereas in the other case a long and costly process of fertility building will be necessary.

The reputation of the universities and polytechnics has hardly recovered to this day. 
Historically, the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the students in the five or so years starting in 1969 can be seen as one more blow to education, one more reason for the public to begin to demand that they should have more control over the educational system.

The fact that BBC and ITV rarely use the old test card any more means that people playing this anonymous instrumental pap are hard up for work. 
Hence the rather desperate PR angle to puff this load of gubbins. 
Left handed people, as we all know, are all in league with Satan, have deformed brains, are prone to violent <tag "512740">behaviour</> because they can't use scissors properly and are secretly planning to take over the world.

If you have been hunting for the perfect diet for a very long  time it will be difficult to stop, actually to believe that good  weight control can be established without resorting to one  special diet that you go on (and then, and this is the snag,  come off again). 
However, you can learn to change your  eating <tag "512740">behaviour</> to get slim permanently, to achieve maximum  health and good physical shape.

Such horses become the weavers, cribbers, and wind-suckers of the equine world. 
These forms of repetitive and obsessive <tag "512740">behaviour</> become so ingrained in the horse, that they become part of the horse's ordinary behaviour even when it is not bored.

`If the White Paper is passed, the multiple sentence will be an attractive sentence (for judges and magistrates) to put offenders on probation but hit them with a bit of punishment as well." 
`The Government angle is that if the probation service was seen to be more punitive and tougher, somehow that would persuade judges and magistrates to use the sentencing options which probation operates, and therefore people wouldn't be going to prison, they'd be coming our way." 
`As probation officers, we say that this is to misunderstand the nature of the probation task, which is built on working with offenders to change their <tag "512740">behaviour</> so they don't offend again."

When the poll result came, the dissenters were crushed by 62.5 million votes to 404,000, as the big institutions weighed in to help secure a 99.4 per cent vote in favour of Ford's #8.50-a-share offer.

Finally, the intolerant inclination is in itself, at least in the eyes of the person experiencing it, worth while or desirable. 
Political theorists tend to concentrate on one hostile reaction as the only possible manifestation of intolerance: the use of coercion. 
They are resistant to the thought that an expression of a hostile view, for example, may be intolerant <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Without moving his eyes away from her dark head he oscillated between the image of the pure lady accepting the spoon, or at least the rose, and the idea of her calling out in a thrashing orgasm of female pleasure as he spurted and spurted in ecstatic triumph on top of her. 
Romantic dreams and sexual callisthenics, chivalry and rape, roses and semen, chocolate boxes and contraceptives &ellip. but most of all, never entirely out of his embattled mind, slowly dragged the shapes of the thousands of words he had so far composed on that day and the thousands he had yet to compose by candle light through the remainder of the bitterly cold night. 
Words with which he hoped to defend himself against imagined conspiracies, actual confession, real Guilts, and words that would too explicitly, too protestingly deny too much of the substance of his own present thoughts as he looked at the girl and his own former <tag "512740">behaviour</> with many, many more of her kind.

His financial circumstances put `exceptional pressure" on the family and could ultimately have led to the children being taken into care. 
TRADING agreements between the BBC and ITV companies and the independent television producers are to be scrutinised by the Office of Fair Trading after complaints that they are abusing their dominant market position. 
The OFT's intervention at the request of the Independent Programme Producers" Association, which represents more than 600 producers, comes after persistent allegations that the BBC and ITV are failing to meet targets on independent production set by the Government, and are indulging in anti-competitive <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Yet they did not encourage the market to reach a verdict on Rover. 
Presumably because the sale of the company had caused such trouble in the past, and because they had become used to spending stupendous amounts of public money on it (<tag "512740">behaviour</> they condemned when Labour was in power), they decided that one last infusion of funds, and a cosy deal with a firm, BAe, which had taken other troublesome industries off their hands (including the Royal Ordnance factories in 1987, for #500m too little according to the NAO), was preferable to the risks of the open market.

The MIS provides the primary means for measuring and reporting performance. 
What is measured, and what is reported, has (by intent) behavioral effects on managers throughout the organization. 
It is critical, therefore, that the measurement and reporting system recognize effects in order to steer <tag "512740">behavior</> toward the interests of the organization as a whole.

There was no trace of the beatings and nothing to document the prolonged isolation, sleep deprivation and constant interrogation that wrecked prisoners in body and mind. 
The estimated 22,000 staff and vast network of informers of the Stasi, the nickname for the former state security ministry, spied on every citizen, tapping phones, intercepting mail, reporting careless talk, contacts with Westerners, unusual <tag "512740">behaviour</> and any sign of dissent.

Nowhere in the vast press coverage and literature of match reports is there any reference to the growth of a violent, organized youth subculture within football. 
Casual, individual violence was almost certainly more common than today but `hooliganism" in the collective and contemporary sense did not take place at football matches. 
It is unacceptable to deduce from the lack of prosecutions that hooligan <tag "512740">behaviour</> was formerly tolerated to such a degree that the culprits were neither censured nor prosecuted.   

800284
We argue that levels of unemployment are also influenced by a variety of social and economic processes surrounding the way the new technology is introduced and the way its impact is handled.

The 10 per cent or so of the population which votes for Sinn Fein appears to approve of, or at least to tolerate readily, the IRA's attempts to kill soldiers and policemen.

Some recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identify.

The general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Mr Ken Cameron, wrote: `With your publications the Daily and Sunday Mirror calling for justice for ambulance workers and others being denied rights by their employers, it is hypocritical of you to be instituting the industrial relations of the 1920s and 1930s." 
Mr Fred Smithies, leader of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, compared Mr Maxwell's handling of the Pergamon dispute to the `autocratic behaviour" of the Government.

The study, published today, says shandy is most likely to be the first alcoholic drink for the under-11s, although this will probably be the fairly tame canned brew rather than the stronger, hand-blended version. 
Young People in 1988, an examination of the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of 33,459 secondary school pupils aged between 11 and 16 in 188 schools in England, Scotland and Wales, found that half the 11-year-old boys questioned, and one third of girls of the same age, said they had had at least one alcoholic drink in the previous week.

But more seriously, I think, underneath that, there is a question of definition and of perspective. 
Now it's one thing to say well, you know, perhaps these are women who take more exception than other women would do, but there comes a point where you have to accept, I think, that there's going to be a shift of perspective, that what women have customarily put up with is no longer what they wish to put up and that I think we ought to be, as it were, acknowledged to have the right or the scope to say we want things to change, and to define or to set out in a process of defining what should be sexual &ellip. appropriate sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> in future.

Most of the early forecasts about the revolutionary impact of the microchip have turned out to be grossly exaggerated and there are, as yet, relatively few empirical studies of new technology at work upon which to build well-founded generalisations.

Defence solicitor, Mr John Berry said that they all accepted that they were out taking game and had taken Terry Brown's gun, which Hogan had been fixing for his friend, to try it out.

GPs should realise that their patients are intelligent human beings and should be treated accordingly, with respect paid to their fears, feelings and beliefs," says the association's annual report. 
The association, which speaks for 190 of the 215 health councils in England and Wales, does not produce figures for the number of complaints received against GPs, but says they account for `a very large number" of the health councils dealt with.

There was no question about the determination and commitment of the Scots midfield although they did seem too frenetic on occasions with the normally precise Paul McStay three times wasting opportunities to profit from the space he was enjoying. 
Norway on the other hand were calm, efficient and in Tom Gulbrandsen they had a central play-maker with guile and control.

Thirdly, it is suggested that other organisational devices, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 6, are also used by management in order to extend their control over labour.

They must therefore give adequate weight to the interest of those individuals in deciding on their actions.

Now there can be little doubt that the climate is changing. 
There is a need and a yearning for moral certainties; for clear lines; for well judged limits to personal <tag "512740">behaviour</>.  

800329
These are largely matters of management responsibility and expertise, not technical issues. 
Employees who have a stake in the <tag "512740">behavior</> of the system, and have expertise to contribute (including, it is important to note, workers at the bench level directly involved with operations), should therefore play a role in establishing the system's specifications.   

800330
Methods shown to be effective in boosting black and Asian recruitment should be spread throughout the country by the Home Office and the Inspectorate of Constabulary. 
In a further attempt to improve the confidence of ethnic minorities in the police, the MPs are to underline the need for officers to be warned against any form of racist <tag "512740">behaviour</> themselves.   

800331
This centers precisely on the area where they are supposed to be most at danger and to have their own choices determined by others &dash. namely, sexuality and marriage and group relations through women. 
There are two main aspects here: the sanctioning of morally dubious <tag "512740">behavior</> and a significant degree of influence over marriage patterns and therefore links between groups.   

800332
It is the vicious downward spiral of drug abuse, drug dealing and violence that terrorises inner city estates, not the police action to free the vast majority of law-abiding residents from a menace caused by a tiny minority. 
It is the action of that tiny minority, day in, day out, which terrifies residents and corrupts the lives of young children who learn to accept this <tag "512740">behaviour</> as normal. 

800333
Only passion, he feels, will carry him across the threshold of adultery, and this is what he supposes passion is like.

The analogy between scientific progress and genetic evolution by natural selection has been illuminated especially by Sir Karl Popper. 
I want to go even further into directions which are also being explored by, for example, the geneticist L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, the anthropologist F. T. Cloak, and the ethologist J. M. Cullen. 
As an enthusiastic Darwinian, I have been dissatisfied with explanations that my fellow-enthusiasts have offered for human <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

`You cannot be a bastard to someone one day and ask them to vote for you the next," one experienced backbencher explained. 
Nevertheless, some Labour MPs do believe that Mr Foster, a teetotal salvationist, has cracked down on bad discipline in the PLP. 
Following a succession of ill-tempered outbursts and suspensions from the Chamber in l987/8, the PLP finally acted by withdrawing the whip from Ron Brown for 28 days, which seemed to put a brake on boorish <tag "512740">behaviour</> by Labour MPs.   

800338
I know about this because many years ago I read a very funny article in a national newspaper by a reporter (I forget who it was) who had been asked to go to all the most expensive and fashionable places in London and give away these cards. 
He had a terrible day, treated to the most vulgar abuse by people from whom you might least expect this sort of <tag "512740">behaviour</>, such as head waiters in very grand and snobbish eating establishments.   

800339
Mrs Lange, in an extensive interview with a Sunday newspaper, said Mr Lange's speech writer, Margaret Pope, was the reason for the break-up. 
`Society is totally sick when people rob other people's husbands, and I think Margaret Pope's name should be exposed," Mrs Lange told the Dominion Sunday Times. 
Mr Lange's mother joined the fray yesterday, saying she was `angered" by the former premier's <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

A university spokesman said the attack had led to increased concern among the staff about their safety. 
`As a gesture to the staff, the curators have decided to close the gardens for a week after the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of this visitor because they feel their staff should be protected." 

800342
Ironically enough, some states, such as Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, have begun the painful process of establishing limited democratic structures, but they do not necessarily accept Western views of what security in the Middle East and North Africa should be. 
And that bodes ill for future stability; after all, King Hussein of Jordan has bowed to popular pressure during the past six months in opposing war and has only earned Western enmity for his democratic <tag "512740">behaviour</>! 

800343
The Russian Secretariat appointed Dzerzhinsky and two others to report on the incident (Rykov also accompanied them). 
They returned to Moscow to exonerate Orjonikidze; the blame was attributed entirely to the Georgians. 
Orjonikidze's <tag "512740">behaviour</> shocked and alarmed Lenin.

He was remanded in custody for seven weeks while a social inquiry report was prepared. 
Miss Recorder Hare QC placed him on probation for two years with a condition that he attend a 60-day offending <tag "512740">behaviour</> course and he was disqualified for three years and thereafter until he passed a driving test.   

800345
Rose told the girls that Moran was secretly grieving for Luke, and the more they discussed it among themselves the more indignant they grew. 
They felt that Luke's whole <tag "512740">behaviour</> was unnatural and hard and unforgiving.  

800346
In a later case, the Divisional Court added to this by saying that a police officer `can be a person who is likely to be caused harassment", under the section. 
This will not happen often because `frequently, words and <tag "512740">behaviour</> with which every police officer will be wearily familiar will have little emotional impact on them save that of boredom", but every case depends on its own facts.   

800347
If I buy apples from the market every week, and there are a number of greengrocery stalls, no one greengrocer will gain much of a long-term advantage over me by consistently exaggerating the quality of his fruit. 
Such opportunistic <tag "512740">behaviour</> will only be worth while, to the greengrocer, if engaged in at the expense of the foreign tourist who is unlikely to visit Oxford market more than the once.

On such occasions, a ban on reaction shots is a small but not unimportant reporting restriction. 
Of the more altruistic objections, the most frequent is that telvisation will encourage both bad <tag "512740">behaviour</> and the yelling of satirical flipperies in the style of Dennis Skinner.

Both drugs are absorbed into T-lymphocytes. 
The substances responsible for this uptake, known as cyclophin and FK-506 binding protein respectively, are different but both seem to be parts of enzyme molecules which allow cells to respond to chemical signals in their surroundings which cause consequent changes in <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

A 29-year-old Bicester man who used a knuckle-duster in a fight has been fined by the town's magistrates. 
Labourer Anthony McMillan admitted using threatening and abusive words and <tag "512740">behaviour</> with intent to provoke violence.   

800351
Stallions, colts, and geldings tend to be rather mean to cows and other animals; they enjoy chasing them relentlessly, and some have a special obsession for chewing the ears of cattle. 
Such `anti-social" <tag "512740">behaviour</> is related to a horse's great need for sensory and mental stimulation.

If you have any old pictures of clergy or congregation really letting their hair down, Local Studies Librarian Malcolm Graham would be delighted to hear from you! 
Even the celebrated &dash. not to say notorious &dash. Vicar of Cowley, the Rev Georgie Moore, looks on his best <tag "512742">behaviour</> in our selection of pictures, which as usual we publish by courtesy of Oxfordshire County Council Department of Leisure and Arts.   

800353
This time her leave-taking has an eerie, almost hallucinatory edge; lying flat in a field of daisies one August afternoon while her infant son rests nearby, she picks herself up and walks away &dash. alone. 
Her disappearance is soon the talk of a town traditionally short on excitement, and gossip is kept fuelled by her continued absence: `It was as though a silence in the shape of her were moving about Myles; as though that world beyond the range of what you see &ellip. had swallowed her whole". 
Ed's grim silence on the subject and his increasingly paranoid <tag "512740">behaviour</> build ominously through the novel; his long-delayed decision to go after his wife springs from an ugly machismo piqued by the snickering tittle-tattle of his workmates.

ALEX HIGGINS, the former world champion, has been summoned by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association to appear before a disciplinary hearing on 6 December. 
Higgins is charged with bringing the sport into disrepute following his <tag "512740">behaviour</> at this year's BCE International at Stoke on Trent and at the Ramada Hotel in Reading.

But this was a comparatively small price to pay for the verve and emotional quality of the whole. 
The affection which Smetana brings to his character delineation, avoiding all stereotypical <tag "512740">behaviour</>, drew a vivid response from all the singers.   

800359
For example, players in a football team are constantly shifting position in the light of what they perceive to be the best interests of the team performance. 
Such co-ordination of activity may take place through what Mintzberg (1979) terms `mutual adjustment", whereby individuals change their <tag "512740">behaviour</> on their own initiative in the light of their knowledge of what other team members are doing, or it may take place as a result of specific instructions from the team captain.  

800360
`Underrecording in both directions" was an important factor, as Dunning and Murphy stress. 
But do these totals prove that hooligan behaviour of a kind broadly comparable with the present day was widespread before the First World War? 
Looking more closely at the kinds of mis<tag "512740">behaviour</> reported in the Leicester Mercury, the descriptions of crowd offences committed within Leicestershire from 1894 to 1914 do not permit any clear reconstruction of crowd behaviour. 

800361
However, Conservatives were united yesterday in condemning the weekend's riots. 
In his Commons statement, Mr Waddington said that about 3,000 `troublemakers" had remained in the Trafalgar Square area after the rest of Saturday's rally had dispersed. 
He condemned the `disgraceful criminal <tag "512740">behaviour</>" and promised that the police would `make every effort to bring to justice those who committed these appalling crimes." 

800362
Five thousand extra police were being drafted in from other areas to keep the rival fans apart, and a 51-hour alcohol ban was imposed in the city and surrounding areas to reduce the chance of trouble. 
Meanwhile, police throughout England were today preparing to combat unruly <tag "512740">behaviour</> by fans at home.

Oxaid publishes a controversial leaflet for students explaining safe sex. 
Never says this is the right <tag "512740">behaviour</> or this is the wrong behaviour, it just says `this is the safest behaviour".   

800364
The following notes of judgments were prepared by the reporters of the All England Law Reports. 
The statutory power of arrest in s 91(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, for disorderly <tag "512740">behaviour</> while drunk in a public place, had not been repealed by s 26 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.   

800365
It was a happy coincidence that he was in London. 
His <tag "512740">behaviour</> was always correct, she could control him easily, and his attention flattered her &dash. so what harm could there be in enjoying it?   

800366
Certainly not. 
In Homer Agamemnon excuses his <tag "512740">behaviour</> by pointing to the action of Ate on his mind; but it does not occur to him to deny his responsibility, or to shuffle out of paying the enormous compensation which he has promised to Achilles.

Only 66 English fans were charged during the 41/2-week tournament. 
An investigation by an Italian team studying hooliganism at the World Cup discovered that English supporters were by no means the worst behaved, coming third in a table of `hooligan behaviour" behind Italian and West German supporters. 
The England team also earned great respect for its sporting <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Professor Anderson pioneered the development of mathematical models of the patterns of transmission of the AIDS virus, which have provided an essential background to international efforts to control the disease.

The name comes from the tuber-like growths in the brain which are sclerotic, firm or hard. 
The cause is a faulty gene which can also produce the abnormal cell development in the kidneys, heart, lungs, eyes, bones and liver. 
The symptoms are as various as the severity of TS, with effects ranging from the small pale depigmented skin patches, or a facial skin rash, to profound mental retardation, epileptic seizures, autistic <tag "512740">behaviour</> and, in rare, extreme cases, death from inoperable tumours.   

800373
More important, in most areas, is infiltration. 
Rain entering the soil disturbs the equilibrium in the same way as water added to the top of the capillary tube or towel; water drains through the unsaturated zone to the water table. 
In regions with marked wet and dry seasons, or where rainfall is evenly distributed, but the winters are cool and there is a distinct growing season, the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of the unsaturated zone becomes very important.   

800374
Mike Read, CODE's vice-president and a former RoSPA road safety director, said: `As a nation, we seem to accept that road deaths and injury are the price we are prepared to pay for the freedom of movement given us by the motor car.

In Rome, the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, called the US <tag "512740">behaviour</> `a very serious matter".

British sources say Mrs Thatcher wants to stress the economics of dealing with environmental problems. 
The price mechanism should be used where possible to encourage people into environmentally friendly <tag "512740">behaviour</>, rather than `bureaucratic controls" run by another top-heavy international organisation. 

800377
How is it possible that what will prove to be an act of technological genocide has been carried out in the name of international law? 
Some would argue that the answer is the Western interest in oil, that the United States and Britain cynically exploited moral abhorrence at Saddam Hussein's <tag "512740">behaviour</>.  

800378
His business with them had been satisfactorily completed; he had taken his money from the American lady and disappeared. 
No, there had never really been anything in Mr McCloy's <tag "512740">behaviour</> to make them believe he wasn't a man of integrity.   

800379
Thus in repetitive situations it would become unnecessary to take the jury's opinion again and again; indeed, `the sphere in which [the judge] is able to rule without taking their opinion at all should be continually growing". 
Yet Holmes's attempt to entrench a `stop, look, and listen" rule for level crossings{fo id=63} was eventually disowned by another master of the common law, Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who admonished on principle against framing standards of <tag "512740">behaviour</> that amounted to inflexible rules of law.

GPs are crucial to early diagnosis.

But it is possible to change, actually to alter your food  preferences, to learn to enjoy exercise, and to achieve an  appropriate body weight. 
Most people fail to change because  they know little about how to alter their <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Rather than having the logic of a program permanently wired into the computer hardware, a program is stored in contiguous memory locations in the same form as data (i.e., using a binary representation). 
The <tag "512741">behavior</> of the computer can be completely altered merely by replacing one program with another.  

800388
I mean many of our students are doing nothing different to what students at other universities do when they go and have a private party in their lodgings. 
But I think one of the big differences with Oxford is that a very, very high proportion of students are living in college and so they're behaviour is visible to college. 
Now, you know, <tag "512740">behaviour</> that's visible to college is behaviour which the college starts to think about wanting to regulate in some way.

It is understandable that Lucas feels unloved by the stock market when its shares were rated at only a smidgeon above seven times this year's earnings at their close of 617p last night. 
The attractions of its chosen means for regaining investors' affections, a free hand-out of warrants exercisable at 720p, are less clear. 
Certainly, if the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of the warrants in the market mirrors that of free warrants distributed recently by BTR and Ibstock Johnsen, then Lucas's shareholders could see some striking short-term capital gains from the instrument, albeit with greater volatility than in the ordinary shares.

Their Edwardian finery concealed coshes, bicycle chains, razors and flick-knives which they pulled on one another in the streets of south and west London.

I gather that the thespians still keep up the old theatrical barriers and frontiers. 
It seems strange <tag "512740">behaviour</> to me, but I am being reckoned another of the renegades who has breached the cordon sanitaire separating theatre critics from the people who make theatre.

Natural selection favoured those ancestral caddis genes that caused their possessors to build effective houses. 
The genes worked on <tag "512741 or 512740">behaviour</>, presumably by influencing the embryonic development of the nervous system.

People are starting to see the prognosis for the planet's health in the same light.

It gave homeless people a criminal record which made it even harder to break out of a downward spiral of poverty. 
If tramps were genuinely endangering the public, they should be charged with threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</>, he said.   

800396
In essence the issues are these: first, given the old traditions of `misrule" and `gang life", how far do contemporary forms of violence in sport resemble earlier ones; second, why did football matches &dash. the stadia, the surroundings, the routes and transport to and from the game &dash. become the chosen site of hooligan behaviour? 
If continuity is the key to football hooliganism, then there should be some solid evidence of similar forms of violence at football matches since the formation of the Football League. 
If discontinuity is the case, there is the alleged distinctiveness of recent crowd <tag "512740">behaviour</> and explanations of it as part of a general transformation of the urban working class since 1945 to consider.   

800397
King Hussein, an Anglophile who knows how a free press works, can be under no such illusion. 
The charitable half-explanation for the king's <tag "512740">behaviour</> is that he is acting out of a sense of pan-Arab beleaguerment, sharpened by the lack of any progress towards Arab-Israeli peace and by the influx to Israel of tens of thousands of Soviet Jews.

I mean it really must make them feel like the world's gone haywire. 
That's right, and I think what has been shown &ellip. if you look at the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of organisations sometimes after a disaster {vocal sound="um"} those that think in that way actually create even more procedures.   

800399
For this reason, adultery should be seen for what it has become, an act of sexual conduct which takes on a symbolic character if offensive to the other partner. 
Once this is conceded, then enquiries into the exact details and minutiae of the sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> so as to announce on its legal pedigree become redundant.   

800401
Some geldings will `tease" mares, and so can be a danger if on the other side of a wire fence, as a mare may strike out or kick at the gelding and injure herself in the fence. 
The degree of a gelding's aggressiveness appears to be governed more by heredity, rather than at what age he was castrated. 
However, it is completely unreasonable to expect a male horse which has learnt the social <tag "512740">behaviour</> of a stallion to completely change its habits, behaviour, and personality because it is castrated. 

800402
If  you feel you are a mess do not worry. 
By setting realistic  goals and tackling your weight control programme in easy  steps you will learn to control your eating <tag "512740">behaviour</> in a way  that pleases and satisfies you.

It remained to be seen whether  either side could contain its more belligerent members. 
The National Farmers' Union exhorted farmers to be on their best <tag "512742">behaviour</>, although there was a feeling even among its leaders, that, if driven too far, the agricultural community  would `rip up &ellip. hedgerows out of sheer frustration and annoyance". 

800404
When cases came to court, the police often dropped charges in return for binding-over orders, issued under an even more ancient statute, the Justices of the Peace Act 1361. 
This did not require proof of any wrongdoing and involved the defendant undertaking, on pain of a financial penalty, either to keep the peace or to be of good <tag "512740">behaviour</>, depending on how the matter was treated by the magistrates.   

800405
If you do over-eat, how long does this last; an hour, a day, a week? 
These three parts of your analysis &dash. Antecedent events,  Behaviour, and Consequences &dash. can be termed the ABC, or  basic units that you need to consider if you want to change  your <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the way you wish.

Like the tiltmeter, though, this method relies for its usefulness on having  a previous, detailed knowledge of the volcano and what is likely to happen  to it before an eruption. 
Sadly, there are few volcanoes outside Hawaii which have yet been studied  in this degree of detail, and it's possible that other volcanoes, with  different styles of eruption, will not show the same kind of <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Here is the realm of secrecy in social life, of purity and pollution, danger and security. 
It is central to every member of the society at the level of personal identity, as member of a social group, and of a whole culture that formulates and prescribes certain strict conceptions of rules and sanctions for sexual <tag "512740">behavior</> and for the reproduction of society through its `proper" conduct.

So instead of being angry, we do more about the house after that &ellip. well I do, anyway." 
It is usual for children who have been bereaved to release emotions through naughtiness or uncharacteristic <tag "512740">behaviour</>, but what impresses Janet Johnston time and time again is how much concern they show for the remaining parent, how responsible they feel.

The illness of Miller is directly attributable to his conduct. 
Not all of this man's <tag "512740">behaviour</> has yet been revealed, of course, but I can assure you that there is one incident to come which in itself justifies almost any degree of the pain that has so far been applied to his brain and his skin and his bones.

In real life people make rather more allowance for the individuality of others: the question Jane Goodall raised in the always excellent Spectrum (Radio 3, Wednesday) was how far we should do this for animals. 
Through her own life with chimpanzees in East Africa, she overturned a number of assumptions about the way chimpanzees behave en masse &dash. it had been thought that they are entirely herbivorous, when actually they enjoy nothing more than a tasty bit of raw pig. 
But she also discovered an immense variety of <tag "512740">behaviour</>, from chimp to chimp and from culture to culture.

In particular, he draws attention to a general attribute of human behaviour, that of opportunism. 
This he defines as `a lack of candour or honesty in transactions, including self-interest seeking with guile" (Williamson 1975, 9), and he assumes that most people most of the time will act opportunistically in the conduct of a transaction, given the opportunity. 
The opportunity for this <tag "512740">behaviour</> is afforded by two sets of conditions.

SIXTEEN police officers were hurt, including seven sprayed with CS gas, and 51 people were arrested at an acid house party, police said yesterday.

The modern world is too complex to accommodate the naive simplifications and assumptions of transnational economics. 
We now operate, Drucker suggests, in a world where chaos theory may be a more appropriate guide to future <tag "512740?">behaviour</> than Keynesianism or any other economic model.   

800417
Clearly, this policing role, giving legal form to religious doctrine, and generally making for an ordered and `tidy" society, was never successfully performed. 
Changes in the values of society, the status of illegitimates, and the advent of reliable birth-control devices robbed the institution of marriage of much of its regulatory quality in the area of sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Your stepsons are no longer toddlers, and being punished physically for minor faults such as forgetfulness is not only humiliating for them, but also very disturbing. 
Most current psychological research suggests that praise and encouragement is far more effective than fear of punishment for establishing good <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Then the suspicion that he was being unfaithful possessed her mind completely. 
She probed the conversation and analysed her friends' <tag "512740">behaviour</> towards her, searching miserably for clues to her lover's disaffection, and often found the tell-tale signs she was seeking because, without the star attraction of her better half, she was a distinctly less welcome guest.

If pigs have occupied the House of Commons recently, chickens are likely to do so soon. 
Battery cages. like sow stalls, came from economic pressures in the days when cheapness was all. they put a stop to predators, parasites and cannibalism , simplified feeding and kept eggs clean &dash. very significant for production when tbe law forbids farmers to wash eggs because of the risk of bacteria getting inside the shells. 
But they denied hens much of their normal <tag "512740">behaviour</> and, in particular, frustrated the urge to nest.

The `argument from silence" will not do, especially in the late Victorian era. 
During the second half of the nineteenth century the police were increasingly active against all sorts of minor public offences such as drunken or disorderly <tag "512740">behaviour</> or the playing of street games.   

800430
The two male lovers were arrested and their convictions were upheld in the High Court. 
Their conduct amounted to insulting <tag "512740">behaviour</> (it insulted the women!) which may have occasioned a breach of the peace (the partners of the women might have beaten up the two male lovers).   

800431
It is as though the transvestite sees gender as something which is rigidly demarcated and so a feminine identity has to be assumed before permission can be granted to do supposedly `feminine" things &dash. from housework to being more emotionally open. 
In this respect transvestism is a form of fractured <tag "512740">behaviour</> which maintains masculinity and femininity as separate, exclusive entities.

The descriptions of the warriors with their shields express not only the Ares outside the gates which fails to break in, but also the Ares inside the house of Laius which is about to break out, and make itself known to Eteocles and Polyneices. 
Polyneices, appealing to Dike and the ancestral gods of Thebes, is as much a contrast to the other attackers in appearance and <tag "512740">behavior</> as Eteocles himself.

I used to think they had done. 
When I heard reports of the changing physical shape of German women, that they were becoming a different breed of women we'd been told from the old, rather heavy, {vocal sond="um"} motherly plain sort of woman who characterised Germany womanhood before the Second World War, well now we read that their shape and their weight and so on corresponds much more to French or British and American norms. 
German young people recently have shown a more revolutionary and radical sort of <tag "512740">behaviour</> than one would have dreamt possible in the old Germany, but in this morning's paper I read of the results of {vocal sond="um"} a public opinion poll recently conducted by the German government about neo-nazism in Germany, showing what seems to be a rather alarming quantity of surviving interest in sympathy for old nazism.

The various features of modern technology which Galbraith identifies as leading to inflexibility create, in Williamson's terms, the small-numbers condition. 
A firm which has invested many years of research and a great deal of capital in a technological development that is specific to only one product &dash. say the engine for an automobile &dash. and for whom there are only a limited number of buyers of that product, is very vulnerable to opportunistic <tag "512740">behaviour</> on the part of the buyer &dash. the car assembler.

Success was  too difficult to attain for practical, identifiable reasons. 
In  trying to pinpoint these reasons, it will help if you think of  diet attempts in three distinct parts.

Well I think personally I think it's a very serious problem, but it's something that we were talking earlier on and asking ourselves in what way, you know, the college or university authorities can set about policing undergraduate behaviour. 
I mean if one can use a slightly awkward word like `policing", and I think there is a sense that none of us want to be acting as substitute parents and, you know, policing student behaviour in a way that suggests that they're not yet fully mature. 
The other side of that is that I think a lot of dons are increasingly concerned at the level of alcohol consumption and the sort of <tag "512740">behaviour</> that can emerge as a result of it, &ellip. you know I do sense that many of us think it's a real problem.

First, only behaviour which is either unwelcome to the person towards whom it is addressed or behaviour which is normally seen as unwelcome is intolerant behaviour. 
Secondly, one is tolerant only if one inclines or is tempted not to be. 
Thirdly, that inclination is based on dislike or antagonism to the <tag "512740">behaviour</>, character or some feature of the existence of its object.

`When asked about sexual harassment, most male managers will say they are not harassed enough. 
They need to know that some behaviour women find anything but flattering." 
The document, Preventing and Remedying Sexual Harassment at work: A resource manual, points out that sexual harassment is not only `unwanted and offensive <tag "512740">behaviour</> which disgusts and angers those subjected to it", but it is also unlawful sex discrimination.   

800449
There were no longer groups of pupils in any one class who were against the school and were wanting to disrupt the teaching of their teachers and really problems were reduced to individuals in each class, one or two pupils, which didn't present the same massive problem to teachers as the bottom streamed groups have done previously. 
So this was a very positive outcome, which the teachers, not unexpectedly, were very pleased about &dash. this improvement in the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of pupils.

The Spalovka Centre says several thousand groups have been formed in recent days, providing a potential backbone of resistance, a la Solidarity, if a clampdown should come. 
Logic alone, though not always a reliable guide to totalitarian <tag "512740">behaviour</>, suggests the hardliners should stay quiet.   

800451
Then, with the Renaissance in the sixteenth century, interest in the art of riding and horsemanship reappeared. 
A Neopolitan nobleman, Federico Grisone, studied Xenophon's books concerning horses; and as a result of this he not only opened a riding academy where young noblemen, including the sons of many European kings and princes, were tutored in the arts of handling horses and courtly <tag "512740">behaviour</>; but he also published, in 1550, his book Ordini di Cavalcare, of which much had been copied from Xenophon's works.   

800452
Women, by biology or effective conditioning (who cares &dash. the effect is the same) have to take their responsibilities to people seriously because if they did not do so in their domestic lives, somebody would die. 
They are then incredulous at the thoughtless self-centredness of male <tag "512740">behaviour</> in a professional team.

When in Auckland A cultural misunderstanding has led to a young Cook Islander being fined #75 by a New Zealand judge for squeezing the buttocks of two white women in a Wellington street. 
Auckland District Court heard that the 20-year-old man `was merely trying to attract their attention, so he could start a conversation" and that such behaviour was perfectly normal on his archipelago. 
However, the judge said that even though the man promised not to do it again, he found such <tag "512740">behaviour</> extremely offensive and ordered him to give #50 to each of the women.

Shill's Ode to St Cecilia, which opens in London next Monday, won a special commendation from The Independent at the Edinburgh Festival, where its extraordinary combination of painterly beauty and raucous comedy set it in a class of its own.

The effect of the first two conditions is to affirm that though a person may be unaware of how well off he is, his willing engagement in his activities and pursuits is an essential ingredient of his prosperity. 
The view to be defended in this section is that a person can have a comprehensive goal only if it is based on existing social forms, i.e. on forms of <tag "512740">behaviour</> which are in fact widely practised in his society.   

800458
I know of no reason for sharing that point of view. 
The ideas of toleration and of intolerance identify modes of <tag "512740">behaviour</> by their grounds and object.

That's right, say what you're going to do, and then you do it. 
Right, O.K., so the three areas of professional telephone <tag "512740">behaviour</> were, when you answer the phone you give a verbal handshake, by introducing yourself, finding out who is on the other end of the line, and asking them if it's convenient to talk.

It is not only advantageous for us to know which of a horse's emotions are destructive to us having a good working relationship with it; but ideally, if we also consider horse will do more for us and give us greater pleasure. 
Even so, when handling and riding horses, we really need to be able to anticipate their emotions, actions and reactions, rather than simply expecting perfect <tag "512740">behaviour</> and performance from them. 

800462
There is a social system in which individuals and groups encounter the dominant forces that produce and reproduce their world in a very immediate and `uncovered" kind of way. 
The hierarchy of status honor and stratification is public, supported by styles of <tag "512740">behavior</>, modes of interaction, and the presence of different controls and sanctions based ultimately (and often proximately!) on force.   

800463
In argument, discussion, punctuating conversation, and talk in what were until recently largely nonliterate societies, the sacred word was circulated and became part of the fabric of life, as it still continues to be. 
The power of oral culture, the integration or sacred formulas into everyday speech, constantly created and reinforced more general structures of authority in society: the power of the father, the seniority of age, the restrictions on the position of women, the weight of model, right <tag "512740">behavior</>.

Recently, however, it caused me a bit of hassle. 
I was driving through a built-up area at about 28mph, in a fully working car, not having drunk any alcohol, and this suspicious <tag "512740">behaviour</> attracted the police who stopped me and breathalysed me. 

800465
Linked to the old-fashioned idea that courts do not make law but merely `discover" or apply it, is the corollary that, while statutes mostly operate only prospectively,{fo id=40} judicial decisions operate retroactively under the pretence that even an overruling of earlier precedent merely corrects an improper understanding of what the law has always been. 
Notwithstanding this fanciful Blackstonian gloss, the conventional retroactive effect of decisions has had a cautionary effect on judicial initiatives especially in areas where reliance on precedent controls human <tag "512740">behaviour</>, as in the case of property dispositions and commercial practices.

As with so many of this family, the foliage is aromatic, and some years ago, on visiting a Charlbury site where a few score grow, I found the clumps of flowers flattened. 
The presence of horses in the field, and tell-tale hairs on plants, implied that they had been rolled upon &dash. an interesting parallel with the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of cats on another member of the family which has thus been named Catmint.

Mr Collor has also benefited from outspoken criticism by Mr Sarney himself, who has urged voters to shun the 40-year-old leading candidate, whom he describes as an intemperate youth unsuited to the dignity of presidential office. 
Although multi-national companies and foreign diplomats describe Mr Collor as `a man we can do business with", there are widespread reports of his aggressive and capricious <tag "512740">behaviour</>, punctuated by several violent incidents at his campaign rallies.

We spoke on the phone a few times after, but our increasing estrangement was both annoying and painful. 
So far as I was concerned, her brief experiment in thinking was over; she had returned to the proper role of the Bas Yaakov, the little girl who never questions or challenges, but patters through life collecting little gold stars for good <tag "512740">behavior</>.

`In one school," Mrs Elliott said, `after the trial of a rather fat bully, the jury suggested he should not be allowed to eat school dinners for a year."

This prepares the horse's neck muscles so its response to the needle is decreased; and it relaxes the vet's hand and arm muscles so that he or she makes a better job of it! 
Additionally, as already mentioned, patting a horse on its neck can be beneficial when trying to shoe a difficult horse; and we pat it in time to the farrier's hammer. 
However, patting horses, dogs, or anything else that is large enough, unfortunately seems to have entered into our folklore as being desirable <tag "512740">behaviour</> with an animal.

Now, this surge in demand was equally clearly created by the grown-up private sector, not by a government binge.

Dr Weller says the figures are, if anything, an underestimate. 
Many of those approached were `too suspicious and socially uncomfortable" to be assessed, while those with the passive, unmotivated <tag "512740">behaviour</> and extreme personality deterioration of simple schizophrenia were not counted among the psychiatrically ill.

Their life-style is dominated by the tides rather than the sun and they are adjusted to the tidal, not the solar, day. 
The important role of the environment in modifying behaviour, the external cause, has already been described. 
Clearly, there will be a wide overlap between the role of the environment in contributing to this external cause of a rhythm, its effect upon an organism's <tag "512740">behaviour</>, and its ability to adjust the body clock.

He said: `I am not looking for limelight or anything like that, and I was only one of the arresting officers, but I am deeply concerned that those men could be detained in prison for the rest of their lives while there is some doubt in the case."

The reason Nicola's GP had sent her to me was that the little girl wouldn't sleep at night, had tantrums and breath-holding attacks, and her mother wondered if she was allergic to something she was eating.

Efforts to improve operations and services to customers &dash. in handling backorders, as just one example &dash. should therefore come mainly through improvements to the transaction-processing system. 
To incorporate the organization's collective knowledge and judgments about operational matters, the system must be kept flexible so that it can adapt to organizational learning. 
Fourth, managers should regard the transaction-processing system as a fundamental mechanism for making long-lasting adaptive improvements in the <tag "512740">behavior</> of the organization.

`The gravest concern throughout has been security arrangements in an effort to minimise the potential problems of crowd disorder and we will continue to offer assistance and co-operation to the Italian government and tournament organisers.

I simply remove myself, calmly, and with a dignity that must be noticed even by those who would have to look the word up in a dictionary to get some faint glimmer of an idea of what the concept actually means.

Emphasis should be &dash. and surely was intended to be &dash. on the fact of breakdown, and not on the formal technicalities of establishing such breakdown. 
Adultery in effect is evidence of breakdown because it represents conduct, on the plane of sexual behaviour, which is outrageous and offensive to the other partner. 
The rationale is that such <tag "512740">behaviour</> may make life intolerable; and that, if indeed it does, the offended partner is entitled to say that the marriage has broken down.

The inquiry was set up by the city council last October with a grant of #65,000 to investigate policing and social conditions in the area.

Later, Tom confirmed that his original story was true. 
Today, after some episodes of marked `anti-social <tag "512740">behaviour</>" (which involved stealing and lying) and following consultations with child psychiatrists, Tom seems to be responding well to intensive psychotherapy, and the outlook is good.

The `continuity" thesis is obviously attractive to the social historian but important reservations and unanswered questions remain. 
In essence the issues are these: first, given the old traditions of `misrule" and `gang life", how far do contemporary forms of violence in sport resemble earlier ones; second, why did football matches &dash. the stadia, the surroundings, the routes and transport to and from the game &dash. become the chosen site of hooligan <tag "512740">behaviour</>?

The Civil War had been fought in the main in the borderlands, precisely where the national question was at its most urgent. 
Despite the Party programme and frequent reiteration of the line, the record in practice seemed appalling &dash. ranging from the Russian colonists, operating under the banners of Soviet power and universal freedom; the arbitrary and cruel <tag "512740">behaviour</> of raw troops operating in alien lands and in danger, far from the watching eyes of Moscow; the role of former Tsarist officers whose instincts were for the patriotic defence of all the territories of the former empire, without concession to local nationalism; to the contempt of the Bolshevik ultra-Left for all forms of nationalism.

The yardstick of legitimacy must never become the propensity to fail; if it does the streets may be used for other forms of protest by those who find all peaceful routes to change barred to them. 
If we turn to the new public order offences in sections 4 and 5 of the 1986 Act, we find that section 4 re-enacts in a more precise form the old `insulting <tag "512740">behaviour</>" section under the 1936 Act which we have already discussed in an earlier part of this chapter.

He believes that if a child misbehaves, his parents have a duty to enforce rules by alternately scolding and punishing him. 
I believe that if a child misbehaves, his parents have a duty to enforce rules by pleading with and bribing him. 
It's not just that I'm a poor disciplinarian; I generally judge our son's <tag "512740">behaviour</> more leniently than my partner does.

Not only does tephrachronology enable a far-flung ash to be uniquely  identified, but if the ash can be independently dated at any single  locality by isotopic methods, then it provides a firm foundation on  which to build the history of a volcano. 
On the academic site, detailed tephrachronology makes it possible to  study patterns in the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of volcanoes &dash. the magma erupted from one volcano may become steadily more acid, or it may show cyclical  changes, or it may even vary consistently during each eruption, starting  off fairly basic and ending up at the close of the eruption much more acid.

A good choice, Graeme Fife's Revolutionary Sketches were full of such engaging details as Robespierre's love of pigeons, Mirabeau's indelicate scheme for compromising his intended and Marie Antoinette's apology to the executioner for treading on his foot. 
A TRIO of academic talks from Prof Cranston weren't too full of anecdote, but in Sounds Of Revolt, we picked up an intriguing pointer to counter-Revolutionary <tag "512740">behaviour</>: the Opera Comique Orchestra, told to play La Marseillaise before every performance, compromised by doing so without tuning their instruments.   

800506
If that cost the match organisers up to #7,500 in ticket returns, the worst damage was inflicted on home pride by the All Blacks forwards and on the image of Welsh rugby by a second attack in four days on a referee. 
Ken McCartney certainly did not ingratiate himself to the Stradey Park crowd, but he did not deserve to be verbally abused, have a punch aimed at him and be kicked to the ground by so-called fans as he left the field. 
It was the kind of unacceptable <tag "512740">behaviour</>, following on from the jostling of England's Fred Howard at Neath, which rugby has largely avoided until now, and must guard against in the future.   

800507
Why should the extent of this activity be of concern to the public authorities? 
After all, in every other aspect of economic <tag "512740 or 512741">behaviour</> we now espouse a liberal philosophy.   

800508
The line is thin between spirited determination and overweening arrogance. 
Rowing with the Commonwealth may do Mrs Thatcher no harm on the substance of the matter but her <tag "512740">behaviour</> in general is becoming a more open issue.

In Brazzaville, she came across Gregoire, ancient and emaciated, kept chained up since 1943. 
All his hair had dropped out and his <tag "512740">behaviour</> was deeply disturbed.   

800510
If one's conclusive judgment is that another person was knowingly or recklessly in the wrong one may feel, and perhaps also display, anger. 
But if the overall judgment absolves him of blame then the fact that aspects of his <tag "512740">behaviour</> were repulsive does not justify feeling repulsion towards him.

The terms of reference for Mr Sadler are: To consider to what extent it is proper for media companies to promote their own, or any associate's, interests in the provision of media services or products. 
Where such <tag "512740">behaviour</> is found to be improper, and taking into account the effect on the relevant markets, to consider what remedies might be appropriate.

In David Pegler's B team, Paul Hull is selected at outside-half, where Cooke rightly regards him as the best prospect in England, even though Bristol decline to pick him there. 
MIKE EDWARDS, the pole vaulter dropped yesterday from England's team for the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in January for his alleged conduct during last summer's World Cup in Barcelona, has denied that he was guilty of `outrageous" <tag "512740">behaviour</> and will decide in the next few days whether to appeal against the ban.   

800513
The whole process will be  easy and it will be fun. 
Before you can begin the process of change, you need to  understand something of your present <tag "512740">behaviour</>, your  attitudes towards food and dieting.

Staff at the gaol said there had been no indication that he might try to take his life. 
His <tag "512740">behaviour</> hasn't been odd and speaking to his cell mate this morning it seems that he didn't speak to very many people either.

PRESIDENT AQUINO yesterday linked her two main political opponents, Vice-President Salvador Laurel and opposition senator Juan Ponce Enrile, to the coup attempt against her. 
Speaking to about 50,000 people at an open-air rally in Manila, Mrs Aquino said the two men should explain their <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Subsection 1 reads as follows: 
`A person is guilty of an offence if he &dash. uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or <tag "512740">behaviour</>, or disorderly behaviour, or displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby."

Given the nature of the business which Balestre rules with an increasingly heavy hand, such a criticism is almost more reckless than the driving tactics of which Senna has been accused. 
For motor sport's president to call the 1988 world champion a threat to others is to undermine seriously both Senna's reputation and the unspoken code of track <tag "512740">behaviour</> based on respect among professionals.   

800522
Why do paperbacks on sale at airports all have their titles in glowing big golden letters to stand out from the rest, when all the others have their titles done exactly the same, and the only one that would really stand out would be an old-fashioned green Penguin? 
Why, when someone refers to lemming-like <tag "512740">behaviour</>, does someone else write in indignantly to point out that lemmings do not in fact rush over the edges of cliffs into the sea, when they know full well that people will go on believing the opposite? 

800523
The office will give evidence to the new inquiry, as will as the Home Office, now seeing the Broadcasting Bill through Parliament. 
Mr Ridley said: `How media companies promote their interests in media services and products raises questions of standards of <tag "512740">behaviour</> which go wider than those that can be addressed by the OFT using competition legislation."   

800524
Fans dress carefully in order to identify themselves within their group. 
The styles change with bewildering rapidity but the way of tying a scarf or the kind of boots and socks worn carry a message about the `hardness" of the wearer. 
`Hardness" is what much of hooligan <tag "512740">behaviour</> is about.   

800525
That is, one needs the literate ability to express oneself clearly; but one also needs the right voice and the ability to be concise. 
Lewis's broadcasts during the war were in three series, and they were written up (published more or less as spoken over the air) as Broadcast Talks (1942), Christian Behaviour (1943) and Beyond Personality (1944). 
The key to them lies in the title of the second series &dash. Christian <tag "512740">Behaviour</>.

Psychoanalysis, for example, was indeed associated with the bourgeoisie, since only they could afford it. 
Yet as Sartre and de Beauvoir acknowledged, this did not in itself invalidate its potential for widening our understanding of human nature and <tag "512740">behaviour</>. 

800529
Over the years Mr Nixon has done his best to repay his debt to Peking. 
On this occasion, however, the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the Chinese leadership has been so provocative and so offensive to all reason that after taking tea with Deng Xiaoping in the Great Hall of the People on the edge of Tiananmen Square, the former president has finally found it necessary to register in public his anger at the killings and the subsequent purges.   

800530
At one level, this definition is rather broad; it refers to threatened acts and the likelihood (rather than the actuality) of damage to person or property. 
It does, however, link the law to the idea of harm and this is valuable in so far as it reduces the risk that boisterous <tag "512740">behaviour</>, or other non-violent activity, can by itself amount to a breach of the peace.   

800531
Richard Simmonds of Waddards Meadow, Witney admitted assault causing actual bodily harm on Darren Reed.

Mr Harris will be joining the Prime Minister's Policy Unit at Downing Street in the New Year and his views, outlined to a meeting of the Centre for Policy Studies last night, are likely to influence her speeches in the future. 
He said: `If we wish to influence men's <tag "512740">behaviour</> rather than just to build the framework within which they behave; if we want to resist all the half-baked and dangerous illusions which will fill the gap left by the futile pursuit of moral neutrality, we have to combat also the idea that the uninstructed conscience is a safe guide."

Who is really in control in El Salvador? 
If it is President Cristiani, he must be held responsible for the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of his military which conducts the terror campaign against civilians, and its accomplices in the army, judiciary and administration who cover the killers' tracks.   

800534
Many of  them are in fact very poor and can ill afford their habit. 
One  school of thought within psychology is that we tend to get  hooked into behaviour patterns if they produce intermittent  rewards. 
That is, when success occurs occasionally, not every  time, and in a fairly random fashion, the <tag "512740">behaviour</> that has  produced this variable success becomes very ingrained and is  difficult to eradicate.

They can be drunk, avaricious, stupid, lazy, absent, pompous; and they can be loving, dedicated &ellip. and understandably concerned about a career in one of the more capricious of short term engagements.

She made the inhaling seagull cry that at that period signified sudden joy. 
Our actual vibrating rush down the runway and our lift into flight and the clunk of the withdrawn landing gear did not distract her from her rapt appreciation of the interior invention: a participatory jet engine for each passenger, with a cream-colored pointed cone of plastic in its center similar to the metallic cones at the rear of the impossibly heavy GE engines outside, whose turbines ground slowly in and out of phase. 
It was a calming bit of self-paced instruction in the <tag "512741">behavior</> of compressible fluids; it was even a useful deception of sorts, since after an hour of feeling that spotlight of air playing over your face, your thoughts full of the remembered sight of contrails in a blue sky as seen from earth &dash. the way they first appear like narrow staves of music a little way behind a very high plane, and gradually fatten into shaving-cream crudities before fading &dash. or of cold rides in the back of pickup trucks, when your cheek nerves grew deadened to the insistent flapping of a lock of hair that now doesn't exist, or of the print ad for Maxell tape in which a man sits in an armchair and experiences a blast of La Mer from his speakers that sinks him deep into the cushions and flings his tie over his shoulder and tips the shade of the standing lamp, you began to think that if the real jet engines were to fail, the plane would float to earth on the output of these tame little verniers alone, as in the parlor trick in which ten guests each use one finger to lift a heavy volunteer &dash. and as the plane lost altitude and the captain flipped desperately through the technical manuals muttering

Thus Christmas Island (105 &degree. E) is seven time zones to the east and jamaica (75 &degree. W) is five time zones to the west. 
But be warned, not all countries abide exactly by these rules, and so slight regional modifications are quite common.

THE ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury ended his ecumenical talks in Rome yesterday with an agreed statement that reaffirmed the commitment of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches to unity, yet admitted they saw no solution to the difficulties presented by the Anglican ordination of women. 
Ian Paisley, who had travelled to Rome to disrupt the visit, accused Dr Robert Runcie of `treacherous and lawless <tag "512740">behaviour</>" when talking of the Pope's role in the universal Church.  

800539
The last has for a long time been the argument most favoured by political theorists. 
It is easy to see why so many people, from Hobbes onwards, have regarded the possession of de facto power, of actual effective power over the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of people, as crucial to the possession of legitimate authority.

Many dieters fail because they try too hard, too quickly. 
Learning to change the habits of a lifetime will take longer  than a week or a month. 
If you give yourself six months to a  year to understand yourself better, gradually to alter your  eating and exercise <tag "512740">behaviour</>, you will become slim and  healthy and you will stay that way.

That compares with an eighty nine per cent increase among drug abusers and a forty per cent increase among gay men. 
Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Aitchison, warned it's now vitally important that heterosexuals adopt safer <tag "512740">behaviour</> patterns. 

800542
It says: `Preventing sexual harassment is part of good management because good managers will wish to ensure that their employees are treated with respect and dignity." 
Employers should consider a policy statement expressly prohibiting sexual harassment, a complaints procedure in which such <tag "512740">behaviour</> is treated as a disciplinary offence and a training programme `to sensitize employees as to what behaviour is impermissible at work".  

800543
Even by his own account, he had continued to make love to her when he knew she didn't want him to. 
That <tag "512740">behaviour</> demanded more suffering than just a few uncomfortable hours.

The referee, George Tyson, issued no cautions. 
Kelly said: `We could have taken action against players on the basis of the film, but preferred at this stage not to go down that road, which would have meant overruling the referee." 
The FA is anxious to establish that players' <tag "512740">behaviour</> is the responsibility of clubs.   

800545
It is not reasonable to suggest that hooliganism is merely inflated by the press and best treated by `radical non-intervention". 
The concentration of several thousand younger fans systematically chanting abuse and taunting one another, forcibly separated by the police and each threatening to attack the other is neither an imaginary problem nor simply a product of imitative <tag "512740">behaviour</> picked up from incautious media coverage.

`God is real," he wrote, `because He has real effects." 
My <tag "512740">behaviour</> has changed since the experience, and I was sufficiently rattled by Canon Entwistle's argument to check for an immediate tutorial with my best friend Little Jo, who is features editor of Ritz.

Little was said for the remainder of the journey. 
Clare and Harry were thinking how puzzling Freddie's <tag "512740">behaviour</> had been without coming to any explanation of what he had `really" been doing, trying to say to them or to the world at large, etc.

Intimate personal details of the victim &dash. who under the present system is no more than a witness for the prosecution &dash. can be used by the defendant in much the same way as any pornographic material. 
Some sex offenders masturbate over the information contained in these documents &dash. a <tag "512740">behaviour</> pattern which may then increase the risk of similar re-offending on release.   

800551
It is the first time professional clubs have been held responsible for employees' conduct in this way. 
Apart from having to answer a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, Arsenal and Norwich must defend themselves under the FA's rule 24 (i) (a), which is generally applied in cases of hooliganism by spectators but states that players and officials, too, must `refrain from violent, threatening, abusive, obscene or provocative behaviour". 
No one who was at Highbury could reasonably argue that the players' <tag "512740">behaviour</> was any different from that which occasionally scars the terraces and is deplored on all responsible sides. 

800552
The percentage of time that meters were occupied during the penalty period fell from 19 to 5 per cent in Pimlico with an increase in `meter-feeding". 
But in St John's Wood there was a dramatic rise in the time parked in penalty &dash. from 8 to 28 per cent. 
The changes in parking <tag "512740">behaviour</> in St John's Wood are similar to those observed in the period after wheelclamping was introduced in central London in 1982.

`Look next door!" Yet in the world's balance sheet of failings one abuse cannot be used to mitigate another.

This year, 26 black or Asian officers left the Metropolitan Police, while only 35 had been recruited. 
Anecdotal evidence of racist <tag "512740">behaviour</> by a handful of white officers could be a reason for the wastage, the report added.

`I read Women Who &ellip. halfway through writing the novel," Zoe&umlaut. says, `it was not a direct inspiration, but it was very validating". 
She stresses that the reader should not focus on the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the mother in the novel to the exclusion of all else; `It's very important not to see a novel as summing up the entire state of women &dash. yes there are weak women but there are also very strong women.

At the end of the over the umpire protested to Vic Marks, the Somerset skipper. 
Julian said later: `His (Jones") <tag "512740">behaviour</> was an insult to cricket and to the boys watching."   

800558
Gascoigne, meanwhile, has been comforted by a deluge of good luck telegrams, which flooded into England's hotel after Wednesday's game against West Germany in Turin. 
As anyone watching his performance against Germany could see, Gascoigne wears his heart on his shirt and finds it hard to contain his emotion. 
Press criticism of his past performances and <tag "512740">behaviour</> have clearly caused him a great deal of pain and the 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder remains as wary as ever about discussing his performances with the Press.

`David Scott is a man of integrity who told me a few days ago that he had been stopped by police and told to `watch out and not let the side down"," Lord Gifford said yesterday. 
Police were singled out for `a wholly unacceptable level of racist language and <tag "512740">behaviour</>" in the report of the inquiry into policing in Toxteth.

Fiona, who is due to marry fiance Paul Silvester of Swindon, in the Isle of Skye in October, is appealing for the return of the ivory silk, embossed with a flower brocade. 
NINE men appeared in court in London after the Hackney Poll Tax riot.

`We believe in keeping the children busy as well as happy and comfortable," the tourist officer said. 
`Even with the hotel full of children, <tag "512740">behaviour</> will never be a problem if some thought is given to children's needs."

I can hear him now, sniffing and purring under his lank hair, pretending to be full of `compassion" or concern as he recounts the endlessly embellished details of my so-called iniquity. 
He will pause every now and then, rolling his large head a little, fingering the rim of his glass, tut-tutting deep in his throat, determined to convey the impression of a charitable fellow who is anxious to put the most favourable interpretation on the strange <tag "512740">behaviour</> of his friends!   

800565
She hung out a great deal with Rachel, her new boyfriend Simon, and Bazza, who shared an apartment on the top floor of a decaying stucco mansion around the corner from her own place in Holland Park. 
After a few months they were joined by Roland, a shy Alain Delon lookalike who moved in with Bazza, steadying his <tag "512740">behaviour</> considerably.   

800566
To bring home how `intimidating and revolting" sexual harassment can be, Michael Rubenstein, the document's author, tells men it would be like `your male managing director stroking your bottom and telling you that your promotion depends upon you going to bed with him". 
A male manager needs to appreciate the difference between that kind of <tag "512740">behaviour</> and his fantasies about an attractive secretary asking him if he would care for a `night of passion". 

800567
The ball was a modern social institution notorious for what one contemporary observer called its `freedom from embarrassment". 
The masks, the jostling crowds, and the semi- darkness outside the ballroom `authorized all kinds of audacious <tag "512740">behaviour</>", according to another commentator, who noted that these occasions were especially perilous for women.

Is it a wonder that Rana Kabbani despairs of all nations achieving standards of civilised <tag "512740">behaviour</> (Free Speech, 9 December)? 

800571
All institutional rights are subject to the mediation of an authority whose task it is, in accordance with the dependance thesis, so to act that people will conform to reasons which apply to them better than if they were to decide independently of the authority's intervention. 
In those instances in which the authority attempts to secure <tag "512740">behaviour</> which respects moral rights by giving them, say, legal recognition, the authoritative intervention puts a distance between the right and the interest it serves.   

800572
Diaries have proved by far the most vivid source for intimate family life in early modern England. 
When Thomas Turner, Sussex village shopkeeper turned thirty, confides his deep hurt at `the seeming distant <tag "512740">behaviour</> with which my mother treated me today, seeming so mistrustful that I should cheat her", he takes us right to the heart of the complex mixture of love and pain which then as now underlies the relationship between adult children and the older generation: Oh, what pleasure would it be to me were there a good understanding between my mother and myself, when I am assured if I know my own heart, that I am so far from having any ill against her that I have almost undone myself to serve her &ellip   

800573
Thomas missed the conversion but Coventry saw the chance of breaking a habit and it was then that they spun the ball for Jones to slip it on to the patient and perishing McKenzie. 
McKenzie streaked away over the 25 and made it to the corner, and from there Thomas landed a superb conversion. 
This, of course, was not at all to Moseley's liking, which manifested itself in some shoddy <tag "512740">behaviour</> before the finish, Adrian Parsons racing across field to put Jones out of action with a kick that went unnoticed by referee Ian Bullerwell.  

800574
The merger would mean the end of competition between the two main suppliers and there was strong opposition from customers also because of the availability of certain grades of salicylic acid and bulk aspirin. 
However, the MMC concluded that it was likely that Rhone-Poulenc would be constrained in its <tag "512740">behaviour</> since customers would otherwise turn to the international market where there was oversupply.

`Where necessary," the White Paper says, `the Government will not hesitate to intervene in order to stimulate improvements". 
Councils will be expected to retain the ability to act as direct service providers `if other forms of service provision are unforthcoming or unsuitable," and particularly for people `with high levels of dependency, or particularly challenging patterns of <tag "512740">behaviour</>, whose care it is essential to safeguard".   

800576
In the same way a horse may want to touch a person that it likes. 
It may want to mouth, not bite, the person's hand; or rest its chin on their shoulder; or brush itself against the person in the same manner as the foal. 
All of which is <tag "512740">behaviour</> that the perceptive horse owner will accept.   

800577
Naville is more cautious than Mallet in the conclusions he draws from his analysis about the extent of conflict with management likely to be brought about as a result of extensive use of such automated technology. 
The negotiating position taken up by the unions will be an important factor, and Naville recognises that the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the unions will be influenced by many factors additional to the technology used in some trade union members' firms.   

800578
The information system therefore has the ability to measure and report on a wide variety of significant matters involved in the internal operation of the firm. 
A sophisticated MIS gives management a very powerful tool, but one that must be wielded with great caution and restraint.

Wantage magistrates yesterday granted his application that the costs should be dropped. 
Mr Hashman was summoned to appear before the court for non-payment of his #156 legal aid contribution after two charges brought against him for possessing an offensive weapon &dash. a hunting whip &dash. and threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</> were dropped in May last year.

An autonomous person is free to choose pursuits which are more short-term, less comprehensive in nature, and which maximize opportunities for change and variety.

It occupies a good deal of our conversation, you know, `How are you?", `What did you think of the play last night?", {vocal sound="laugh"} `Are you having a good meeting?", you know, and then of course all decisions involve human evaluations because a decision is a choice among alternative images of the future really and we evaluate these and pick out what we think is the best, obviously.

Natural selection favours those genes that manipulate the world to ensure their own propagation. 
This leads to what I have called the Central Thebrem of the Extended Phenotype: An animal's behaviour tends to maximise the survival orthegenes `for" that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.

A murderer who was led to his deed by the foreseen inner logic of his autonomously chosen career is morally worse than one who murders because he momentarily succumbs to the prospect of an easy gain.

It is of course not only the learning which is not explicit. 
Even once the patterns of <tag "512740">behaviour</> have been learnt much, indeed most, of our behaviour remains based on learnt semi-automatic responses (i.e. ones which we can, usually with some effort, suppress, but which we normally do not deliberate on and which we are not explicitly aware of).

The second group, of those &dash. even including some Party members &dash. who had previously been apathetic or negatively disposed towards the Party, thought that the time had now come when they could air their feelings. 
Among the things they criticized were the arrogant <tag "512740">behaviour</> of Party leaders, their lenient treatment when misdemeanours came to light, the fact that `the awaited purge in the Party had not taken place", the wringing of money out of the people in constant collections, and the `large, elegant cars" in which Party functionaries travelled to and from work.

British sources say Mrs Thatcher wants to stress the economics of dealing with environmental problems.

Let me note in brief that I am not supposing that deliberation on the nature of the reasons always accompanies the formation of desires nor that one always gives oneself an explicit account of such reasons.

If his warts-and-all account of the typical Salomons bond trader is to be believed (and few have observed that unwholesome breed from closer quarters), the single-minded pursuit of personal gain is of such paramount concern that loyalty and trust are purely tribal, rather than ethical, concerns. 
They only matter insofar as they contribute to the twin goals of life, which are (a) survival and (b) making more money. 
After all, when you have spent the best part of the decade growing immeasurably rich by trying to `stuff" anyone you deal with (including your own clients), a simple act of disloyalty like writing a book about your employers &dash. even ones that are paying you dollars 225,000 a year &dash. hardly registers on the scale of poor <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Lewis's broadcasts during the war were in three series, and they were written up (published more or less as spoken over the air) as Broadcast Talks (1942), Christian Behaviour (1943) and Beyond Personality (1944).

For, it becomes apparent, the terms of the competition between States are constantly changing, and therefore the struggle for national independence is never complete. 
In earlier times, the pressure of a system of competing States was perhaps less all-encompassing, and the agenda of economic development much more sketchy. 
There was time for domestic forces to shape a new nation without the same constant vigilance of the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of neighbours.   

800622
There are two reasons for this. 
Firstly, a young horse may not have formed a habit of accepting  things as they are and automatically always behaving in the same way. 
Secondly, because the horse is not locked into a certain form of <tag "512740">behaviour</> by habit, it will have more flexibility of mind about doing new things and it will be more easily motivated to learn something different.

There is a difference, I think, between making children feel responsible for righting the wrongs {vocal sound="laugh"} of the world that we as adults have created, but at the same time to be able to enable them to think constructively as to what they can do. 
I mean it is true that this is adults' business, as it were, and that children are not in a position that they can take the sort of action that is going &dash. certainly in the Gulf situation &dash. to effect a change. 
I think that might be slightly different in terms of the environment, but nonetheless I think there is a way of encouraging children to think about and to be thoughtful about the sorts of choices that we make in life and the effects of our <tag "512740">behaviour</>, without overwhelming them with the sense that it in fact is their responsibility.

This, of course, in effect defined the situation as too serious and irreversibly set in motion for it to be changed by the informal chat and encouragement of his peers.

But have the limited changes which have occurred been beneficial? 
If one takes the views of the architects explicitly asked this question in the AMERG survey then the reforms seem to have been a mixed blessing (42 per cent thinking them to be beneficial and 29 per cent not to be). 
For some architects, the removal of regulations which both provided guidelines for <tag "512740">behaviour</> and also limited the areas in which competition existed has provided a stimulus since they now feel able to compete more efficiently in a less restricted arena.

In the zikr men experience a concentrated power. 
They call out and chant the Names of God, thrust backward and forward in violent rhythmical movements, give themselves up to forces that seem to come from outside, from the word of the Divinity that reaches down into their nerves, their breathing, their innermost physical and emotional natures.

I mean where do you think that line should be drawn? 
Well for my own part I think that one can educate students as far as possible in terms of what appropriate behaviour is, and I think that you can police students with disciplinary measures when it's absolutely clear that when they know what the inappropriate behaviour is they nevertheless make a choice that they're going to move beyond those boundaries of appropriateness. 
But I think that to allow those two sort of issues to get too inseparable, as it were, to &ellip. so that we simply regard ourselves as being in a position to issue directives about <tag "512740">behaviour</>, which don't acknowledge that these are young people who have to learn to be autonomous, then we get ourselves onto a hiding for nothing.

It also demonstrates why most lesbians and gay men have little confidence in the police and why most anti-gay crimes go unreported. 
What is urgently required is a police commitment to record homophobic assaults, in the same way they now monitor `racial incidents", to clearly establish the scale and pattern of `queer-bashing" and to ensure the appropriate policing measures to stamp it out. 
To give homosexuals the confidence to report anti-gay crimes, without fear of vilification and harassment, it is also important that the police disciplinary code is amended to make homophobic remarks and <tag "512740">behaviour</> a disciplinary offence, and that lesbian and gay awareness courses become a standard part of police training.

This approach uses models to deduce future trends in the volume of employment and unemployment from a comparison of expected improvements in productivity and volume of production.

Cold War influences filtered through gradually and merged with a growing concern about the effects of increased leisure and affluence on the young, especially the problem of delinquency. 
`It is easy to ridicule the `that's not cricket old boy" attitude," remarked Wolfenden, `but in its deeper (and usually inarticulate) significance it stili provides something like the foundations of an ethical standard which may not be highly intellectual but does have a considerable influence on the day-to-day <tag "512740">behaviour</> of millions of people."

The act was a compromise designed to quell the fears of those who felt that a single no-fault ground for divorce would make it too easy to dissolve marriages. 
But paradoxically, abetted by cost-cutting procedural changes which by the late 1970s had made divorce little more than a rubber-stamping exercise, the easiest grounds have proved to be adultery and intolerable <tag "512740">behaviour</>, the old fault-based grounds in a new guise.

The variance is disposed of by (1) absorbing it as an overhead cost for the period, (2) rolling it forward as an adjustment for the charging rates during the next period, or (3) retroactively changing rates and adjusting user bills so that the computer center ends up with a zero variance. 
This chargeback scheme suffers from a number of serious defects: The system is complex, expensive to administer, and difficult for users to comprehend  Users generally have considerable difficulty relating their use of the computer to the itemized charges they receive  The costs levied against a given user depend not only on his own use of the system, but also on other factors over which he has no control (e.g., the efficiency of the data center and the total load on the system); consequently, the user may find it difficult to make rational tradeoffs between the cost and value of the services received  Rates are set at a level inversely related to expected demand, leading to undesirable user <tag "512740">behavior</> &dash. for example, if demand goes down, the rates for the remaining users go up, thus further depressing demand  Retroactive adjustment of rates to distribute the residual variance has several perverse effects: (1) it patently serves no useful managerial purpose in allocating resources, because users have no control over their past usage; (2) it makes planning and budgeting very difficult for users, since they do not know the charges until after their consumption of services; and (3) it does not encourage efficiency on the part of the data

`Why no films," asked Anderson in 1958, `on Teddy Boys, nuclear tests, loyalty of scientists, bureaucracy, etc." Why, one might ask in reply, did Anderson never develop stories that engaged with just these issues, even when Joseph Losey, an American who came to Britain in the early 1950s as a refugee from the communist witch-hunts, could deal with them in an assignment for Hammer.

Another is a walking bomb: a Malaysian species of carpenter ant ruptures an enormous poison-filled gland during fights, spraying poison over the enemy as it explodes. 
Explaining social <tag "512740">behaviour</> &dash. such as such selflessness &dash. in terms of biology (especially genes) is a hallmark of sociobiology, of which Dr Wilson is regarded as the father.

And the Soviets, consonant with their current national mood, lost. 
As for the Germans, the way they tackled, not dirty at all, but unwilling even when on the ground to stop tackling, tells one everything about the wirtschaftswunder and why some countries have more trade surplus than they could lay linoleum on. 
High skill, correct <tag "512740">behaviour</> and incomparable motivation, all the qualities are there which built the BMW and made Dusseldorf a city where you could eat off the pavement.

It deserves to be widely read, not only by psychotherapists and their patients, but also by National Health Service administrators and their political masters. 
There are many varieties of psychotherapy; but I find myself in agreement with the authors' broad definition: `The systematic use of a relationship between therapist and patient &dash. as opposed to pharmacological or social methods &dash. to produce changes in cognition, feelings and <tag "512740">behaviour</>."  

800842
The objection to this has nothing to do with its real-life plausibility, but on the use to which it is put in the play. 
Like Albert Finney's paralysed hand in Another Time, that scar is too obligingly symbolic, and Levee's nothing-if-not-thorough revelation of his ordeal seems like a free-standing interlude that does not properly affect subsequent relations between himself and his colleagues, or his <tag "512740">behaviour</> in front of them to the white bosses.   

800843
I felt like that there was a &ellip. a more concrete and unifying decision, that &ellip. that decision was what are Dr Carrington's chances of being alive in any sense whatsoever, in having any human experiences, away from the hospital and away from this ventilator? 
And once that decision was made, then I felt that there was sort of humane <tag "512740">behaviour</> that was required.

`I'm sure it will be a welcome improvement," said United secretary Mick Brown. 
`We got the original reduction of the wings because of good behaviour and after Hillsborough the general behaviour of football fans has been much better." 
Fences were installed at the Manor &dash. as at football grounds throughout the country &dash. because of pitch invasions and missile-throwing and the threat of violent <tag "512740">behaviour</>, particularly in the wake of the Heysel disaster in 1985.

It is reinforced by the further recognition that what is now valid may well not be in the future, and that some people see earlier than others when changes in accepted opinions and values are needed. 
These people are entitled to use ridicule as a weapon to provoke such folk as the sweetly unreasonable Mr Akhtar and the rest of us into wondering whether our beliefs, including our most deeply held convictions, are actually tenable. 
Since our beliefs strongly influence our actions, getting them right is socially very important, and therefore the freedom to question received wisdom, especially in fields that affect the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of large numbers of people is, indeed, in the liberal view, a hugely important means, if not a vital precondition, of ensuring that `the interests of weaker individuals and groups" are not harmed by `the irresponsible attitudes and actions of the more powerful".

She pointed out that the water companies had spent more on their pre-privatisation television adverts than Renault, Nescafe and Coca-Cola put together. 
This, of course, is the source of the old adage for extravagant and wasteful <tag "512740">behaviour</> &dash. spending money like water companies. 

800847
You are probably experiencing a few second thoughts, not to mention sleepless nights, over a business arrangement or joint undertaking. 
The real bone of contention &dash. as if you didn't know &dash. is money. 
But what really seems to hurt and rankle you most at the moment is the <tag "512740">behaviour</> and attitude of a friend or close companion &dash. and no doubt the Full Moon in Aries on the 14th will prove challenging and even emotionally upsetting.   

800848
The first two sessions of Margaret Thatcher's third parliament were dominated by the legislative programme, the coming session will be dominated by the economy's behaviour. 
To this must be added the behaviour of the Prime Minister and that will be a factor too in determining whether the Government can pull back from being some 10 to 13 points behind in the polls. 
It is easier to forecast the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the Prime Minister than the performance of the economy.  

800849
Mr Lawson's authority was also at stake, since it was being eroded by Sir Alan. 
If Mrs Thatcher and Ms Weaver cannot see that, they must be amazingly blind or insensitive. 
Mrs Thatcher's <tag "512740">behaviour</> can be explained in two ways. 

800850
But there's no doubt that if we do assume that the cuckoo's gape is a powerful drug-like superstimulus, it becomes very much easier to explain what is going on. 
It becomes easier to sympathize with the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of the diminutive parent standing on the back of its monstrous child.   

800851
Adultery in effect is evidence of breakdown because it represents conduct, on the plane of sexual behaviour, which is outrageous and offensive to the other partner. 
The rationale is that such behaviour may make life intolerable; and that, if indeed it does, the offended partner is entitled to say that the marriage has broken down. 
Conduct on other planes of <tag "512740">behaviour</> may equally produce the same result.   

800852
Other projects are in the pipeline. 
In an associated move, Monsanto, the giant US chemicals company, has committed itself to a new three-way company, Oxford Glycosystems, to pursue the potential of oligosaccharides, complex braids of various sugars whose importance was discovered by Professor Raymond Dwek of the Department of Biochemistry. 
It appears that these act as a kind of `area code" holding vital information about cell origins and <tag "512741">behaviour</> &dash. and hence give clues to the fundamental defects in malfunctioning cells.

Mares, reared by themselves, may react to the stallion also with fear or aggression; and even if they are in season,  they may refuse to respond to a stallion's overtures. 
Horses kept in isolation, often the fate of colts after weaning, frequently display the inappropriate behaviour and high anxiety which is demonstrated time and time again in laboratory animals reared in impoverished environments with reduced mental and sensory stimulation. 
Horses kept in small yards by themselves develop repetitive patterns of abnormal <tag "512740">behaviour</>, such as whirling in circles and chasing their tails.

Although neither was an art movement in any conventional sense, they were both launched as aesthetic revolutions which were scheduled as critiques of everyday life; and in this they were both surprisingly successful. 
They were connected in their respective negations in their respective negations by the activities of the Situationist International, founded in 1957 upon a premise of refusal to enter the conventional cultural space and to combat the burgeoning `society of the spectacle" with <tag "512740">behaviour</> which had no place in the museum or the gallery &dash. let alone the sale-room.

This woman considered that acclaim and total commitment to a role were indications of professionalism and consequently considered herself unprofessional. 
Morgan and Beecher represent the compromises that had to accompany professional success for many women &dash. specialism in domestic architecture, environments supportive of traditional middle-class family structure and sex roles, and a restrained, lady-like personal life; in sum, a highly conservative identity. 
Not even the few successful women architects questioned the precepts that had for so long defined the status of their sex, neither as models for their own <tag "512740">behavior</> nor as models for their clients.

Given Berkeley's immaterialism, however, the idea that things have real essences (be they scholastic forms or corpuscular constitutions), which are the cause of their properties, simply has no place. 
Natural philosophy should not be thought deficient because we are ignorant of the ultimate causes of the characteristic properties and regular <tag "512741">behaviour</> of things.

Thus demand, and therefore employment, continues to fall. 
Though a number of economists have made further assumptions about the <tag "512741">behaviour</> of the economy &dash. principally, that firms will substitute labour for capital if there is unemployment (because in those circumstances real wages will fall) &dash. which remove some of the apparent instabilities, others have concluded that the instability still occurs because the actual rate of investment may still not necessarily coincide with the warranted rate of growth for full employment.

But then her parents noticed the occasional `blank" in which she appeared to switch off from her surroundings.

Bryan Gunn, the Norwich goalkeeper, has been accused of bringing the game into disrepute for his outspoken views on the same subject. 
The same catch-all charge has been brought against four managers &dash. Harry Redknapp of Bournemouth, Everton's Colin Harvey, John Bird (York City) and Ray McHale (Scarborough) &dash. for alleged misconduct of one sort or another, and two teams, West Ham and Wimbledon, are to appear before the FA's disciplinary committee on 19 December, accused of disreputable <tag "512740">behaviour</> during their ill-tempered Littlewoods Cup tie at Upton Park on 22 November.

A spokesman for LVMH said: `We have to ask whether or not what he is doing is compatible with his role as a director of the company.

All are vulnerable, because all are capable of being described as likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress. 
Nor is it a complete answer to persuade the police officer or magistrate that such <tag "512740">behaviour</> is not threatening, or abusive, or insulting.

Both Manchester United and Aston Villa had better-than-average records.

Unfortunately, this week's earthquake &dash. magnitude 6.9 &dash. struck 95 miles north of Parkfield, the area Dr Lindh has been so assiduously wiring. 
The incident illustrates both the vast advances in technique made over the past couple of decades and, poignantly, how much further scientists have to go before they can make reliable and useful predictions of earthquake <tag "512740">behaviour</>. 

800870
Well, yes, I think there's a recent report of a rape {vocal sound="um"} &ellip 
I think if you're saying well, you know, a rape is a very, very serious incident of sexual harassment, that's not to be denied, and I think it goes beyond being sexual harassment. 
But there's a whole range of <tag "512740">behaviours</> which one can include in sexual harassment, going from fairly mundane every day things which just grind people down and which grind people down because they happen on a constant basis, to very serious once in a while sorts of behaviours, and to try and categorise them as major or minor doesn't really get us very close to being what the issue is about.

Palliser's John Huffam becomes increasingly cynical, and he begins to wonder about the motives behind his quest for justice.

The crucial bit of lateral thinking is the idea that stotting, far from being a signal to the other gazelles, is really aimed at the predators. 
It is noticed by the other gazelles and it affects their <tag "512740">behaviour</>, but this is incidental, for it is primarily selected as a signal to the predator.

However, gaining weight is  not an inevitable part of getting older. 
If you have never dieted before, or have had just one or  two unsuccessful attempts, please do not start on the `yo-yo"  of losing weight, gaining weight, losing weight that we  described earlier.

Every previous combined operation from Gallipoli to Anzio &dash. or, going further back, Walcheren in 1809 and La Rochelle in 1629 &dash. had run true to form: no proper survey beforehand, confusion of command, improvization leading through muddle to failure.

THE latest phase of a study of 411 South London boys, which began in 1961, when they were eight to nine, was published yesterday by the Home Office.

This year, 26 black or Asian officers left the Metropolitan Police, while only 35 had been recruited. 
Anecdotal evidence of racist behaviour by a handful of white officers could be a reason for the wastage, the report added. 
All police forces should make it plain that `it is the duty of all officers to ensure that racist <tag "512740">behaviour</> by police officers is eradicated".

After eight weeks of enrichment Misha showed less of the `stereotyped" movements which so upset some zoo visitors. 
The zoo says this behaviour developed in the 1970s, when Misha was a circus bear kept in a small wagon. 
It is wrong to call such <tag "512740">behaviour</> mad, neurotic or depressed, Dr Redshaw says, for these are terms from human psychiatry which have been inappropriately applied to animals.

The timing of this operation, and the insidious way in which it was carried out, was designed specifically to undermine the morale of these soldiers by exercising an extreme traumatic effect upon their wives and families and creating a situation where they have been needlessly exposed to such an extent that many will now have to give up their homes, involving greater hardship and expense. 
Irrespective of denials to the contrary, there will be no doubt in the minds of the Ulster people that this scandalous <tag "512740">behaviour</> at the behest of the Northern Ireland Office will be seen as a sop to the Irish government and to those anti-unionists whose one aim is to have the regiment disbanded.

It allows performance of the sales department, for example, to be measured by its incremental profit contribution as determined by the scheduling system. 
The alternatives of using, say, the average contribution over a broad product group, or &dash. even worse &dash. sales revenue, fails to recognize such things as current costs and capacity constraints; as a result, these measurements might motivate dysfunctional <tag "512740">behavior</> on the part of the sales force by encouraging it to emphasize low-profit (but high-commission) products.

But this is as it should be since one can, and people often do, show disrespect to others, including disrespect which amounts to denying their status as persons, by acts which do not violate rights.

A strong and extended version, which emphasises the high fixed costs of employing labour which do not arise when capital is substituted for labour, would suggest that the societal optimum might only be achieved if government in some instances subsidised jobs to a level beyond the costs of the individual's direct wage costs. 
Fourthly, the macro-economic argument about the instability of individual firms' investment behaviour was advanced. 
Firms may assume a growth rate of the economy below that which is attainable, invest accordingly, and cause the growth rate to fall by their own <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

What do you think sexual harassment is? 
Well I think there's a difficulty here because I think one of the questions is a matter of perspective {vocal sound="um"} how do you define &ellip. how you define what sexual harassment is is to an extent a factor of your perspective on the question in that I think that tutors who have been thinking about it in recent years, and women tutors, who have taken the lead in it, have tended to think about the implications from the institutional perspective, that is how do tutors behave to their students and in what ways may that affect students' studies and their live in the college. 
I think what's very striking about the report which the students' union have recently published and are circulating around the university, is the extent to which they have tended to define sexual harassment as being as much or at least as much a problem between students, a problem of <tag "512740">behaviour</> between students and a problem of the sort of atmosphere in the colleges in terms of how that affects how peoples lives feel and and how they are &ellip. how their behaviour &ellip. what sort of behaviour is acceptable.

Only a little more indirect is the effect of the same cuckoo genes on the behaviour of the besotted host. 
In exactly the same sense as we may speak of cuckoo genes having (phenotypic) effects on the colour and shape of cuckoo gapes, so we may speak of cuckoo genes having (extended phenotypic) effects on host <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

She needed to confide in someone, to present the situation as clearly as she could, to ask for advice about her sister's condition. 
She is surely not herself, this cannot be normal <tag "512740">behaviour</>, Kathleen Lavender said to herself, day after day, night after night.

It is submitted in response that the gradual movement of social history is towards such a position of recognition and facilitation, and that this position should indeed be adopted. 
The task becomes one of persuading people that earthquakes will not follow, and that this step is merely another in the gradual process of acceptance and tolerance of varied social and sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> begun by the Sexual Offences Act, 1967; that there is nothing harmful or threatening in institutionalizing, and thereby recognizing, a relationship which some fear, many object to, and most still misunderstand.   

800925
While Ruben was almost obsessively discreet, her husband's affair with Susannah McLeod was common knowledge. 
One or two of her closer acquaintances among the diplomatic wives had spoken to her about her <tag "512740">behaviour</>, and its consequences for her marriage, but the alarm these warnings aroused only made her feel more anxious.   

800926
For years we have {vocal sound="um"} all, producers and consumers, we have supported the idea that a market would be a reasonable way to set up reasonable levels of price. 
And suddenly, {vocal sound="um"} very probably, by {vocal sound="um"} unreasonable <tag "512740">behaviour</> of some of the operators, we are seeing the emission of shock waves to the market which actually are extremely negative for the economy of the community as a whole, and for the oil world {vocal sound="um"} as well.

And if you haven't already heard just about everything that can be said about soccer hooligans, then you haven't been listening to Radio 4. 
Fair enough, it can't be repeated too often that groups of young male, working class lads have always been prone to violent <tag "512740">behaviour</>, too much booze and distinctively peculiar clothing and hairstyles.

Henderson remained unshaken. 
He carried the Labour party conference in favour of sending delegates to Stockholm, though none actually went &dash. the seamen refused to carry them. 
Henderson had to resign from the war cabinet, after being kept `on the mat" while his colleagues discussed, and condemned, his <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

Lloyd Honeyghan, who lost his WBC world welterweight title to Marlon Starling in February, returns to the States to fight Delfino Marin in Tampa, Florida on August 24. 
The Scottish international Mo Johnston and the Swede Stefan Rehn have both been fined by Fifa for `unsportsmanlike <tag "512740">behaviour</>" after pulling out of transfer deals to join other clubs.

In those parts they clearly believe that attack is the best form of defence. 
I was told that I was biased against the club, that I had clearly never attended their ground, that in any case I would not now be made welcome at the ground and that I, as a Welshman, had no right whatever to question the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of English supporters. 

800932
I can well imagine how he must have looked that day, framed by the doorway of the vehicle, his dark, severe presence quite blotting out the effect of the gentle Hertfordshire scenery behind him. 
Those were, Mr Charles recalls, strangely unnerving moments during which he too, despite not having participated in the preceding <tag "512740">behaviour</>, felt engulfed with guilt.   

800933
Mr Modrow welcomed the Volkskammer's decision to investigate allegations of abuse of office against the previous regime. 
His own government's motto, he said, would be `openness and honesty, orderliness and lawful <tag "512740">behaviour</>, modesty and economy and professional confidence instead of slogans or glib phrases". 

800934
BRITAIN HAS acquired an unenviable reputation for mob violence and thuggery in three areas &dash. football grounds, prisons and, now, the pavements of central London itself. 
There may be a deep sociological explanation for the recent outbreaks, possibly encompassing theories about the secularisation of society and the alienation of a poorly-educated section of the workforce, but on the surface the differences in the circumstances surrounding each area of brutish <tag "512740">behaviour</> are more apparent than the similarities.

That's right. 
And so children are learning that <tag "512740">behaviour</> from their parents.

BURNING cigarette ends thrown from vehicles endanger lives by distracting other road users, warns the AA. 
Regional director David Kyd said: `This kind of driver <tag "512740">behaviour</> also shows complete disregard for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and the environment."

He paused again and once more there was utter stillness. 
M. Dupont went on in a calm, deliberate voice: `My only question concerning Mr Lewis is this. 
To what extent does his abominable <tag "512740">behaviour</> exemplify the attitude of the present American administration?   

800938
On the other hand, her maltreatment of colleagues has grown more conspicious &dash. it caused serious political damage at the time of the last reshuffle, as well as when Mr Lawson resigned &dash. and her manner in television interviews is becoming more bizarrely artificial. 
If the cumulative embarrassment which her <tag "512740">behaviour</> has provoked in some Conservative MPs should spread, she will be in danger.

`Chimpanzees are so like us intellectually and physiologically, it's absurd to think that we can't have some kind of rapport." 
So long as the animals' <tag "512740">behaviour</> is meticulously noted, she argues, empathy and intuition can be invaluable in interpreting it.

Instead, he was found guilty of the lesser charge of obstructing a police officer just before midnight on August 14. 
His brother, Patrick, was found guilty of using threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</>.

The scene was thus set.

A group of young related males clustered around the sheikh on his visits. 
They learned the proper form of prayer, the zikr ritual, his opinion on certain questions of holy law, and the form and model of <tag "512740">behavior</> that were contained in the term Muslim and locally embodied in the sheikh.   

800943
If these examples of Senna's driving were as dangerous as Balestre makes out, then why did the governing body not deal with them at the time? 
Senna's actions occasionally have been questionable, but to brand him as dangerous is a precedent which Balestre may later regret. 
This is the first time that a driver's track <tag "512740">behaviour</> has been attacked in such a manner by FISA.

Tolkien had taught him that the inability to believe in Christianity was primarily a failure of the imagination. 
This insight had enabled Lewis to recover all the things in art and in life which he had been enjoying since imaginative awareness dawned. 
In Puritania, religion had been the stuff of cant, of laws, of promised punishments for <tag "512740">behaviour</> which the Pilgrim's inner conscience could not condemn.

There has been very little work done on the psychology of the horse. 
Most studies consider only social <tag "512740">behaviour</> in the herd, or readily observed facts, such as that the horse is easily frightened, or that it will work better if it is rewarded rather than punished.   

800949
The prosectuion told the court that Irons outwardly led an exemplary life as a born-again Christian. 
The only clue to explain his <tag "512740">behaviour</> was the pornography he hid under the mattress in his mother's home. 

800950
To bring home how `intimidating and revolting" sexual harassment can be, Michael Rubenstein, the document's author, tells men it would be like `your male managing director stroking your bottom and telling you that your promotion depends upon you going to bed with him". 
A male manager needs to appreciate the difference between that kind of behaviour and his fantasies about an attractive secretary asking him if he would care for a `night of passion". 
Mr Rubenstein points out that it is a problem which affects large numbers of women: `Sexy <tag "512740">behaviour</> becomes sexual harassment when it is not wanted.   

800951
The Hibs supporters stayed on for more than 30 minutes after the final whistle. 
Their exemplary <tag "512740">behaviour</>, which was praised by the Belgian police, was rewarded when the track-suited Hibs players trotted out to wave a final farewell.

That Foot, at his best, is among the most fertile and iconoclastic of polemicists makes this tract particularly disappointing. 
More than half is devoted to trying to make us feel guilty about the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of our ancestors.

A few lines earlier, commending his concubine to the queen, he had said: `No one submits willingly to the yoke of slavery (953)."

These matters receive far too little attention in the design of an MIS. 
For the most part, simple measures of performance are chosen by default or tradition, often at quite low levels in the organization, without much concern about their implicit policy declarations or the <tag "512740">behavior</> they are likely to induce.

At this time I may give Rosemary a few moments attention. 
Last night I built the GPO Tower from her lego bricks, but while my back was turned Rosemary smashed it to pieces, and then had the nerve to laugh amongst the rubble. 
This is typical of her <tag "512740">behaviour</>.   

800956
After half an hour in each case, the mother was released to join her infant and the accompanying male. 
The experiment revealed a complex interaction between male and female dominance rank and visibility of the mother in determining male responses to infants and female <tag "512740">behaviour</> towards males.  

800957
A FEMALE abuser such as Beatrix will almost certainly have been abused herself as a child and will probably have been abusing small children since her early teens, perhaps as a babysitter, according to Michele Elliott, director of the charity Kidscape. 
She says: `Sexual abuse of children is compulsive, addictive <tag "512740">behaviour</>.   

800958
What is striking, therefore, and of importance for the drive and dynamism of the regime, is that the undiluted `Hitler myth" &dash. the fully-fledged cult of the `superman" Leader in all its glorification &dash.  embraced the Nazi e&acute.lite almost in its entirety, and was not simply regarded cynically as a functional propaganda manufacture. 
If the glorifying speeches and writings of subleaders during the Third Reich itself are no proof of this, the <tag "512740">behaviour</> of Nazi leaders arraigned at Nuremberg and post-war memoirs (for all their obvious apologetics) demonstrate it conclusively.   

800959
Joanna Innes, the senior proctor. 
Yes, I wanted to emphasise the way some men feel constrain before, not because I want to suggest it's now becoming a problem for men and we should be worrying about them, but because you asked what prospects there were for doing something about it and I think if something's to be done about it, and it's a problem of everyone devising new standards of <tag "512740">behaviour</>, it's very important that quite large numbers of men should be prepared to play a part in trying to work out what these standards should be, and there is quite substantial interest in trying to do that, both at the level of the teaching staff at the university and at the level of the undergraduates.   

800960
But the central problem is not efficiency; it is attitude. 
All along people were so jolly intent on weasling their way through, trying to justify themselves with half-explanations designed to deceive, that no-one seems to have asked the basic question &dash. is this honourable <tag "512740">behaviour</>?

WHY should a hunting whip held by Joe Hashman be classed as an offensive weapon when hunting whips brandished by other people at the same time were not so classed? 
That was the question I posed last year after Joe had been arrested by Wantage police and accused of possessing an offensive weapon (a whip) and of <tag "512740">behaviour</> likely to cause distress and alarm.

THE fences behind both goals at Oxford United's Manor Ground are to be reduced in height in line with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations. 
Work will begin soon on lowering the height of the fences by around one metre in the centre area behind the home fans' London Road terracing and the same will follow at the visiting supporters' Cuckoo Lane end. 
The height of the London Road fence was lowered at both wings last year following good crowd <tag "512740">behaviour</> and soon nowhere will the height exceed 2.2 metres (about seven feet).

Miss Elisabeth Hudson, defending, said Mynes had a problem with drink and a quick temper. 
Robert Lewis, 21, of Merton Walk, Bicester, who appeared in court with Mynes in connection with incidents at RAF Upper Heyford on August 12 last year, admitted a charge of using threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</> within the sight and hearing of PC Michael Goodwin.

About 1,500 young people attended the event. 
CALLS FOR an independent body to monitor the Government's use of statistics followed two recent cases which attracted widespread criticism, but some academics have long been concerned about the independence of British official statistics. 
The Prime Minister's decision to refuse funding for a survey of sexual <tag "512740">behaviour</> to further research about the spread of Aids, and a new way of counting people in the poorest category of the population which reduced the number by one million, caused controversy.

During the evening, Rhodes had had an argument with his girlfriend, which may have caused him to drink so much &dash. two bottles of wine, before buying another bottle from which he said he had had one drink. 
Rhodes regretted his <tag "512740">behaviour</>, having lost his temper when he was very drunk, said Mr Smith.   

800971
The very desire to seek extremes, to reveal taboos, to allow free range to imagination, implies the existence of repression. 
In the fifties, when the grey-suited corporation man, his corsetted wife right beside him, was so very anxious to conform to every social nicety, all thought of breaking out beyond highly defined rules of social <tag "512740">behaviour</> was severely repressed. 

800972
One of the most enduring and widespread of these prejudices, which achieved the status of a popular myth, was that `things weren't like that in my day". 
Geoffrey Pearson's recent Hooligan: a History of Respectable Fears gives a persuasive account of law-and-order myths, which shows that people continually locate `the good old days' of decent <tag "512740">behaviour</> at some time about twenty or thirty years in the past.

In a report to the meeting, HEA officials say there is insufficient data on the spread of Aids and HIV, the virus that can lead to the disease, among heterosexuals. 
The `vast majority" of reported UK cases can be related to other risk <tag "512740?">behaviour</> such as intravenous drug-taking, sex with a bisexual man or infection while overseas.

This common modern phenomenon might be called The Nicola Six Syndrome, after the female victim character in the recent Martin Amis novel London Fields, which was subject to the same objections as the Potter. 
There is more of a problem on screen than page &dash. a nipple is a nipple is a nipple, however you hedge it round with disapproving voiceovers &dash. but it is still possible to argue that London Fields and Blackeyes belong on a different shelf from Rubber Times and Knave. 
A condition of misogyny or pornography is that male <tag "512740">behaviour</> is endorsed while female emotions are ignored.

Second, it was thought unfair that the successful should subsidize the unsuccessful and, last, that the system would put undue pressure in favour of parties evoking strong sympathy but with small prospects of success. 
Clearly, the establishment remained hostile to this avenue of experimentation. 
The preceding discussion has been concerned primarily with the effect of fee arrangements on litigation <tag "512740">behaviour</>, with special emphasis on the comparative incentives of the contingent fee on would-be plaintiffs.

Unfortunately, as Bollas suggests, his irrepressible desire to be outrageous in the end alienated not only fellow analysts but lay friends.

I write to put the record straight following some misleading remarks (19 December) on the subject of policing arrangements at Chelsea Football Club. 
Chelsea have an unenviable reputation for attracting a particularly unpleasant minority hooligan element &dash. in addition of course to the vast majority of genuine and well behaved supporters. 
The minority have a reputation for abusive language and <tag "512740">behaviour</>, intimidation of rival supporters and a willingness to engage in disorder.

In some cases, they earn the role effortlessly. 
The twelfth Duke of St Albans, descendant of Charles II and Nell Gwyn (Charles II's mistresses spawned four of the dukedoms), used to tell the porter at Brooks's Club to `wind up my watch for me, there's a good fellow", and threatened to turn up for the 1953 coronation with a live hawk on his arm in his role as Hereditary Grand Falconer of England: when told he could only bring a stuffed bird he decided not to go at all.

Perhaps a club or two will even introduce genuine membership, an element of the democracy that is good enough for the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona but not, apparently, Manchester United; Martin Edwards's idea of learning from Real Madrid was to start a (now defunct) basketball club. 
Whether or not the English clubs return to European competition &dash. that depends on our Government's view of crowd <tag "512740">behaviour</> during the World Cup &dash. a European super league seems certain to start in some form during the decade.

In normal circumstances, of course, I would not dream of doing this.

Some of the other dancers made life difficult for them at first, resenting the physical advantages the South Africans had enjoyed, growing up far away from the hardships of wartime Britain. 
On the other hand, Maryon Lane, one of two further South African girls (the other being Patricia Miller) who joined in August 1947, thinks the chief cause of ill-will had been the obnoxious <tag "512740">behaviour</> of one person, and says she herself never suffered from resentment but was accepted by the company where everyone seemed like family.

But if he decides to start paying back the debts incurred in the recent borrowing binge, we could be looking at an increase in spending of only 1 per cent. 
It can be seen that the uncertainty about borrowing <tag "512740">behaviour</> dwarfs the traditional problems of estimating the exact growth of real incomes.

Animal rights activists have been bailed on condition that they do not attend any hunt meetings in England or Wales. 
In a letter to the Independent, a representative of the Irish Freedom Movement alleged that, at the annual anti-internment march in London on 6 August 1988, there were over thirty arrests, with the charges ranging from threatening <tag "512740">behaviour</> to affray and some accused being `granted bail only on condition that they did not attend political meetings or marches".

Many on Wall Street warned that the price was too high, the deal too leveraged and that a cash flow problem loomed. 
But this was regarded as `sour grapes" by those caught up in the heady environment of the mega-takeover deals. 
The day of reckoning was eventually brought about by a change in consumer <tag "512740">behaviour</> which forced stores across the US to resort to a dramatic round of price cuts to entice buyers.

Nozick's concern for the separability of persons revolved round persons as impacted upon by others, as patients of others' actions. 
He wishes to limit the degree to which one may be compelled to make sacrifices for the sake of others, without limiting one's moral obligation voluntarily to make sacrifices for the sake of others. 
This led to concentration on the difference between the different ways of affecting other people's <tag "512740">behaviour</> which appeared incapable of bearing the strain of his argument.

It is possible to imagine that one of them was brightening with the low cunning of unscrupulous greed and that the other was already stepping into that heavy gloom of shame and guilt which could only take him to the hospital or worse. 
Because I am a writer caught up willy-nilly in the polluted air of our own times, because I cannot avoid entirely the language, assumptions, <tag "512740">behaviour</> and weirdly chiliastic bombast so typical of a corrupted age, I can force myself to imagine by what tormented mental process an educated and rational man of some sensibility moves from the cerebral subtleties of Keynsian economics to the animal crudities of purchasing unsatisfactory and momentary sexual release from a cheap little whore.

So it was a great disappointment to discover that she was quite unlike all the other home-bred horses, and that she would give nothing in return to those who cared for her and bestowed affection upon her.

Even so, there can be little doubt that by the middle of the war, the hold of the `Hitler myth" was among German youth, too, in a process of disintegration. 
Though the majority of youth continued outwardly to behave in a conformist manner, the growth in numerous big cities of deliberately non-conformist and sometimes actively oppositionist youth groups delighting in physical as well as verbal attacks on Hitler Youth brigades, wearing `western" clothes, aping English mannerisms, and listening to jazz, showed that Nazism was losing ground among what had been its strongest area of support. 
These youth cliques, with picturesque names like Edelweisspiraten or, based on their taste in music, Swing, were regarded as a political menace by the regime, and for the most part their <tag "512740">behaviour</> did contain a distinct political dimension &dash. rejection of the Party, the Hitler Youth, the regime, and the Fu&umlaut.hrer himself and the lack of freedom and dull uniformity which his rule represented.

Political theorists tend to concentrate on one hostile reaction as the only possible manifestation of intolerance: the use of coercion. 
They are resistant to the thought that an expression of a hostile view, for example, may be intolerant behaviour. 
Secondly, as was observed above, it is often thought that only if a person judges another or his <tag "512740">behaviour</> to be wrong or evil can he be tolerant of that person or of his behaviour.
