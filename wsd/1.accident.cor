Senna's evidence has been heard by the FIA, but the lengthy deliberation by the three-man tribunal means that the case is not as clear-cut as Jean-Marie Balestre, the FIA president, believed on the night of the race.

Before the contract could be performed one of the barges was lost. 
The court held that the contract had not been frustrated by the loss of the barge, not by the decision of the shipowners, whether reasonable or not, not to use their second barge for the performance of the contract. 
In construing the contract, the expression `perils or danger and <tag "532674">accidents</> of the sea" described a proximate cause of loss which could arise with or without negligence.

The NHS in Oxford region could save hundreds of thousands of pounds by promoting the use of cycle and horse riding helmets, according to head injury specialists. 
In a new report they say that just one patient severely disabled by head injuries costs #50,000 in the first year and perhaps ten times that much over a lifetime.

The causes however, can be simply put. 
For every person who exercises their freedom to drive a car there is a cost to many more in terms of delays on public transport, because cars aggravate traffic congestion; in terms of safety, because busy roads lead to <tag "532675">accidents</>; in terms of dirty, infrequent services, because money is diverted away from better public transport; and in terms of quality of life, because cars cause pollution.

Jochen Rzeniechi-Weyers, the officer leading the hunt by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) for the army officer's killers, insisted yesterday that the gunman in the passenger seat of the stolen silver Mazda used by the terrorists had been shot by police soon after the murder. 
The Federal Prosecutor's office, based in Karlsruhe, would only confirm that traces of blood had been found in the car, which was abandoned on crashing into a ditch after breaking through a road-block.

A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency said the agency's name had come to be associated with the story by a rather circular route. 
Dr Hans Friedrich Meyer, the second in command of the agency's division of public information, explained that the document being sourced as the agency's internal assessment of the <tag "532675">accident</> was nothing other than a daily resume of international press clippings which was in turn citing Spanish newspaper accounts of the accident.

It is not ghoulish to enjoy the pictures in which the creator of Sally Bowles and Mr Norris decays before our eyes, for in some of the most tragic portraits, the spirit of the young writer still shines out through sunken and puzzled eyes. 
The Bachardy technique is magnificent, but this is not an art book, any more than it is an adjunct to the history of literature: it is a moving expression of caring, working on which brought Bachardy through that crisis we all dread most; he went on sketching hours after Isherwood's last breath, until he felt able to let the once-loved body go off for dissection at the hospital to which the author had bequeathed it.

The girl was not running or thrashing her arms in a way which would have alerted the supervisor. 
Although the plaintiff, without any fault of her own was suddenly thrown on the ground, she could not recover damages from the council because she had not shown that the council was negligent in the way that it looked after the girl, and that the <tag "532675">accident</> was the result of that negligence.

Now, just over two years ago, when it was first mooted that the Rockhill site would become a permanent gipsy site, we did then {vocal sound="um"} conduct {vocal sound="um"} interviews in the town, and we interviewed something like two and a half thousand people, of which ninety five per cent said that they were against a site in that particular place.

Well let's forget about that, let's forget about the two thousand odd people who've said no, let's forget about the fact that there were these <tag "532675">accidents</> in that road, because no we've got the M forty the A forty four &dash. well the A thirty four as it was &dash. has been relieved of a lot of traffic and from a point of view from the Gipsy Working Party Committee they may well feel that they are even more entitled to go ahead with this site.

Contributory negligence has ever presented a challenge to juries' tolerance of a rule of law repugnant to the popular sense of fairness. 
That a negligent plaintiff should be barred from all recovery, particularly when he was much less to blame than the defendant, seemed a draconic and disproportionate sanction for carelessness.

This year he said the county council was planning and building better cycle ways, running more cycling courses, promoting cycle safety helmets and providing traffic calming measures. 
To cut pedestrian accidents, Mr Peverel-Cooper said the county was providing road safety teaching programmes to teachers and for motorcyclists, who were involved in fewer accidents last year, the county is setting up a training association and promoting training. 
For motorists he said the county was encouraging advanced driving courses, promoting alcohol-free driving, running hire schemes for car baby seats and developing road <tag "538889">accident</> prevention schemes.

He did, riding the fastest Tour time trial ever at nearly 34mph. 
In his three previous Tours he had never finished lower than third, but few believed, after his shooting <tag "532675">accident</> of 1987 and later injuries, he would get back to the top so quickly or so dramatically.

A pylon leg is used for six weeks, then a `proper leg" with a strap replaces the pylon until the patient is ready for the suction limb.

The guidelines, which deal with potential hazards such as getting lost, hypothermia and bad weather, say parents should be informed fully of the educational value of the trip and of any potential dangers.

There is, in fact, no means-limit on criminal legal aid, although some recipients pay means-tested contributions. 
Since the mid-Seventies, when policies first appeared, legal expenses insurance has concentrated on a narrow band of claims arising from car <tag "532675">accidents</> and house ownership; many policies are cheap add-ons to house insurance.

In May alone there was a sharp increase of almost 1 1/2 per cent in manufacturing output, which kept unit labour costs down to 3 per cent, but officials said the figure could well have been erratic. 
The energy sector has been affected by a 29 per cent drop in North Sea oil extraction over the past year to its lowest level for a decade, which has largely been due to a series of <tag "532675">accidents</> beginning with the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988.

His Lordship could find nothing irrational or perverse in the chief constable's decision. 
By virtue of section 4 of the Fatal <tag "532675-p">Accidents</> Act 1976, a widow was entitled to claim, as part of the damages for her husband's death, a dependency amounting to two-thirds of her husband's pension, even though she was still receiving half the amount of that pension from her husband's employers by way of a `widow's allowance".

BROWSING through the 1989 edition of the Government Statistical Service's Social Trends (HMSO #21.95) at the beginning of this year, I came upon a passage in the chapter on Health and Personal Social Services which may go some way to explaining what must have puzzled many people about the way we are governed: the background to decision-making, and its sustaining rhetoric: `The Department of Transport estimated that the average cost of a fatal road <tag "532675">accident</> in Great Britain in 1987 was just over #555,000, compared with just over #522,000 in 1986."

The first questions which faced me after my own Worst Day were simple. 
Was it an accident, was I pushed, or was I just plain stupid?

LARGE-SCALE plans for evacuating thousands of people in the event of an accident at nuclear power stations are to be developed by local authorities, the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear Installations disclosed yesterday, writes Paul Brown. 
Until now emergency plans have only been for small <tag "532675">accidents</>, with the possibility of anything on the scale of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl officially discounted.

After social inquiry reports had been presented to the court, his solicitor, Mr Jamie Champkin, told magistrates that Fullbrook was `very ashamed" about the incident.

The visit, organised with the co-operation of the Soviet authorities, will allow the inquiry to learn how the Soviet Union organised the emergency evacuation of thousands of people three years ago, and what contamination and health problems remain 40 months after the world's worst civil nuclear power station <tag "532675">accident</>.

By contrast, the American preference for pluralism and the free market has led to a proliferation of compensation structures whose aggregate of benefits and expenditures can hold its own in comparison with the welfare efforts elsewhere. 
The federal social security system, it is true, makes only a modest contribution to <tag "538889">accident</> compensation, free hospital care being provided only for the elderly (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid), and disability benefits only for persons (under 65) who suffer total and lasting disablement.

Mr Gardiner said the evidence showed that a misted-up windscreen in the Metro and the efforts of Mr Stratford's passenger to clear the screen with a rag had distracted Stratford.

I understand that the surveyors and engineers department of Oxfordshire County Council are considering improvements as a result of this fatal <tag "532675">accident</>, but perhaps the most significant statement made during a helpful conversation with one of the department's representatives was that national standards for signals are governed by the overriding need to keep traffic flows moving during peak periods.

In a universe in which, if we can speak objectively, hazard played a major part because of their structural place in society (their marginal economic role, their almost total lack of access to those institutions that might permit of an active transformation of their life circumstances by themselves), `chance" as a conception or organizing notion played no part. 
For such terms as <tag "532674">accident</>, hazard, and chance deny the notion of determination and of purposeful meaning.

I think it will be generally agreed that in this case the life of the person in my example is not autonomous and that his choice and the nature of his options are enough to show that he is not. 
That is, our judgment that he is not autonomous is unaffected even if the example is developed to show that his predicament is a result of a series of bizarre <tag "532674">accidents</> and coincidences resulting from the breakdown and freak behaviour of several computers in some futuristic society.

For instance, the rule of contributory negligence applicable to collisions at sea differed from that established by the common law of tort.

Nobody with the job of managing the nation's principal safety agency could be complacent.

Hence the invention of defences like contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow-servant rule, which until the advent of workers' compensation for all practical purposes precluded recovery for work injuries in the belief, no doubt, that industry was not ready to shoulder the burden. 
These defences, particularly that of contributory negligence, also disqualified a substantial proportion of other <tag "538889">accident</> claims and heavily discounted settlement values. 

800164
The driver and three other passengers were seriously injured. 
Other people killed in weekend road <tag "532675">accidents</> include a 20-year-old man whose soft top Triumph Spitfire overturned on the A338 near Ringwood, Hampshire; two men whose Ford Escort crashed into a stone wall at Bodmin, Cornwall; and a boy of 16 whose brother-in-law crashed his vehicle into a tree felled by high winds near Winchester, Hampshire.

Work was uncertain, and one might say that immediate contingencies and short-term coping with the world as it happened to them formed their universe. 
But insofar as their lives were predominantly controlled by external forces that acted on them in often uncomprehended and mysterious ways, leaving them with little illusion of the power of men to make their own life circumstances, it was striking that the concept of chance or <tag "532674">accident</> was almost entirely absent.

The pressure of time which helped the conservationists win this compromise from the Government was made more urgent by the impossibility of extending the parliamentary session, due to the forthcoming royal wedding.

The other was at Reigate. 
As in previous years there were more accidents on the clockwise carriageway (296) than on the anti-clockwise (248).

At the Oxford Road junction there had been 11 injury accidents, including four fatalities, in the past ten years. 
All but one of the accidents involved a vehicle turning right out of Oxford Road. 
The proposed roundabout would reduce speed on the A423, reduce the number of <tag "532675">accidents</> and make it easier for vehicles to emerge from Oxford Road.

Other countries share neither this constitutional perspective nor nearly the same radical orientation. 
For them, ordered social change is within the exclusive province of democratically elected legislators expressing a majoritarian will; judges both lack democratic credentials and are by training and association unqualified and averse to becoming agents for social and political change instead of merely guarding the rights of individuals in a conservative tradition. 
Mass <tag "532675">accidents</> have become a familiar incident of the modern way of life, a by-product of advancing technology in the production, distribution, and use of toxic agents, dangerous pharmaceuticals, fast modern transport, and other hazardous activities.

Does this sufficiently identify the plaintiff as one injured, rather than merely threatened, by the defendant? 
The traditional requirement that the plaintiff prove causality against each defendant on a balance of probabilities reflects our notions of procedural fairness in the individualized confrontation typical of random <tag "532675">accidents</>.

Such legislation in the torts field as intermittently passes into the statute book is usually a response to a momentary crisis, unrelated to any wider principle and thereby becoming hostage to constitutional attack on grounds of discrimination. 
Examples are statutes imposing liability in limited amounts on parents for wilful destruction of property by minor children{fo id=27} or an occasional reversal of a court decision that has touched a sensitive nerve in constituents, like the decision imposing liability on a social host for supplying excessive alcohol to a guest who later causes a driving <tag "532675">accident</> on the way home.

John Newman, the union's general secretary, of the union, said: `We believe the growing use of badly-crewed, badly-maintained and badly-managed ships means that it is not a question of `if" a major incident occurs but `when".' 
The British fleet's `excellent" safety record is contrasted in the report with `appalling" statistics relating to flag-of-convenience vessels. 
The Numast submission also cites a series of several recent <tag "532675">accidents</> and `near misses" around the coastline, the British coastline, all involving foreign-flagged ships.   

800177
That choice is usually dictated by a combination of various factors in which safety and cost tend to be prominent but not exclusive. 
The difficulty is aggravated where the particular feature did not cause the <tag "532675">accident</> but only aggravated its consequences, as when a motorcar should arguably have been `crash-proof".

We've just heard that in Berkshire, the M four, junction six to seven, that's Slough on the A four, if you're heading that way this evening, traffic's slow there going westbound and obviously could cause you a few delays.

Mr Gardiner said it was a very sad case involving a man who had been regarded with affection and even veneration by his work colleagues. 
The only person to see the <tag "532675">accident</> was warehouseman Mr Garry Rawlings, who was working at the next door premises of tractor manufacturers Cubota (UK) Mr Rawlings, of Cotmore Close, Thame, said he was working at the side of the warehouse when Mr Giles came and asked him for some pieces of wood &dash. something which he often did.

The trouble arose over an issue seemingly self-explanatory: when is a product defective? 
To placate conservative critics the point has been frequently made that the new liability was not absolute like insurance: the manufacturer was not liable for every accident resulting from use of his products, only for <tag "532675">accidents</> caused by a defect.   

800182
`There has been a 45 per cent increase in slight injury accidents especially among drivers and adult cyclists," he said. 
`This trend is against a backdrop of continued decline in accidents in the city during the last five years."

For Huysmans, denial is vital &dash. and denial always bears specifically upon the traumatic perception of female castration. 
Thus it is no <tag "532674">accident</> that in his Preface Huysmans declares that his formal project to {deadGuys}. requires the suppression of {deadGuys}.

The statistics show that millions of vehicles have been carried by rail shuttle over 30 years through Alpine and similar tunnels without one ever catching fire. 
In the Alpine tunnels, drivers and passengers sit in their vehicles on the shuttle trains.

Just as we do not know what to do with our bodies when they are alive, disposing of them when they are dead presents greater problems. 
It is no <tag "532674">accident</> that the most gripping section of his latest novel, The Innocent (Cape, hbk #12.95), is the part where his hero and herione dismember the corpse of the latter's ex-husband.

800193
In Sweden, Stubbings and his co-driver practised at night. 
They had no back-up crew, temperatures were 40 below, and he drove knowing an <tag "532675">accident</> in the back of beyond meant they would die of exposure.   

800194
Usually, that passion curves back clumsily on itself, because most of Ford's characters are wary of going anywhere arrow-straight.

800195
By making his hero the only voice of science in the film, Ray also lets slip an opportunity to represent the science that is actually a superstition in its own right, the fantasy science that chooses to leave waste, risks, side effects and long-term consequences out of its equations. 
India, after all, was the site of the worst industrial <tag "532675">accident</> to-date, the Bhopal disaster, which you would think would give a concerned film-maker plenty to think about.   

800196
Where people are crowded together, particularly when public order is in question; where hazardous materials are being moved; where traditional industrial disciplines and organisation are breaking down, as in parts of the construction industry, there is real reason for anxiety. 
In serious hazard regulation, too, the stakes are high and the so-called `human factor" in <tag "538889">accident</> causation is an issue.   

800197
Like Direct Line it pays a one-off #15 sum to new customers to cover transfer charges.

800206
The high percentage of un- or under-insured tortfeasors, even in motor-car accidents, ensures that the accident cost is in practice often met by defendants, such as municipal authorities responsible for street maintenance, whose share of fault may be negligible. 
In addition, it has encouraged a vast extension of `duties of affirmative action" so as to impose responsibility on individuals and entities for mere omissions to prevent the risk of accident-prone behaviour by others; hence the liability visited on owners of commercial and residential premises for robberies and rapes, for failures by public officials, insurance agents, and the like to inspect the work performed by others, for the ubiquitous failures to warn consumers against misuse of products and an unimaginable array of dangers. 
In short, anyone even remotely related who could have interceded to prevent an <tag "532675">accident</> is exposed to the risk of substantial liability.

When war broke out, `Bomber Command was incapable of inflicting anything but insignificant damage on the enemy" .

Despite on the spot first aid, doctors were unable to save a teacher's finger after an <tag "532675">accident</> with a circular saw. 

800218
But it is one thing to say that nineteenth-century tort law, despite discarding strict liability in favour of `no liability without fault", took a narrow, puritanical view of entitlement to compensation; it is another to accuse it of a deliberate policy to subordinate all else to a goal of economic expansion. 
Indeed, a noted lawyer-economist has given his benediction to the overall record during this era for reflecting a design to bring about an efficient (cost-justified) level of <tag "532675">accidents</> and safety rather than any systematic bias in favour of industrial growth. 

800219
When there's a fatal accident on the roads we do nothing because people don't think: `There but for the grace of God go I."

Until the mid-twentieth century the range of tort liability, though slowly expanding, remained under tight judicial controls. 
Although the remarkable breakout of liability for negligent harm in the nineteenth century had established the framework for an effective <tag "538889">accident</> law, it was accompanied by control devices which ensured that the burden of liability would not exceed society's capacity to absorb it.

Marriage has congealed into a dull routine of unfulfilment; in a brief and horrifying flashback we learn of the incident which has finally pushed it beyond redemption. 
Ramona, seven months pregnant, had one night tried to flee their small home town, Myles, and lost her right hand in an accident on the road out, `radiant with ice in the January cold". 
Life hitherto had been punch-drunk from domestic violence &dash. `the thick flat sounds of unremarkable brutality" &dash. but their first fight after the <tag "532675">accident</> presents Ramona with a moment of epiphanic insight: `she'd sensed in that instant when he'd checked his swing the culminative proof that he thought of her now as a cripple he had no right to hit".

The human factor is a main component in 90 per cent of cases, and in 70 per cent proper management effort might have prevented them.

William Klein's highly individual approach to the medium has influenced hundreds of news photographers world-wide. 
An American living in Paris, he has always been fascinated by the actual process of creating an image, the different ways of showing his subjects rather than with the subject itself.

From 1931 to 1950, the scientist is usually a biologist or medic of some kind, concerned with the secrets of life &dash. Frankenstein is the obvious paradigm.

Neither of them seemed wholly convinced when the team manager, Peter Collins, took the audacious decision to recruit the 25-year-old Englishman at the start of the year but it looked a good deal brighter when Herbert burst on to the F1 scene with a brilliant drive to finish fourth in his first grand prix, the Brazilian. 
Since Rio, though, he has experienced considerable difficulty keeping his head above water. 
He is struggling still to recuperate from serious leg injuries sustained in a Formula 3000 <tag "532675">accident</> at Brands Hatch last August and, despite his obvious long-term potential, the restricted movement in his ankles has made it difficult for him to manipulate the brake and throttle pedals with suitable agility, particularly on some of the tighter circuits of recent races.

Juries frequently ignored it, the courts had strained to engraft exceptions like the `last clear chance" rule, and some statutes had abrogated it either generally or, more commonly, for specific situations. 
In its origin and heyday, the defence may well have served a calculated social and economic function by reducing the cost of compensation in the interest of building a stronger economy. 
Yet not only had industry long ceased to be regarded as in need of such a subsidy, but there was now a broad consensus that compensation of <tag "538889">accident</> victims was a desirable social goal that could be accomplished by loss-spreading through the conduit of liability insurance and ultimately passing the cost to the consumer public.

FALL-OUT from last Thursday's accident at a Spanish nuclear power station swept across Europe yesterday &dash. but the Vandellos 1 reactor has been spreading clouds of confusion, not radioactivity. 
Spanish newspapers affirmed that the fire in the turbine hall (a non-nuclear area) of the power plant had triggered the worst nuclear <tag "532675">accident</> since Chernobyl, and the reports cited an internal document circulating within the prestigious and impartial Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency as authority.

Occupiers' liability was brought under the embracing standard of the common duty of care in 1957,{fo id=18} the immunity of highway authorities fell in 1961,{fo id=19} followed by the final remnants of marital immunity in 1962. 
These were all statutory reforms, while the courts during that period contented themselves in the main with modest refinements of established principles. 
Not until the appointment of the Pearson Commission in 1972 was the need felt to take a more critical look at the general panorama of <tag "538889">accident</> compensation, especially the relationship between tort law and social security which had burgeoned under the impetus of the Beveridge Report of 1943.

The report also looks at casualty rates for men and women in cars and how they vary with age. 
It finds, for example, the male drivers up to 20 years old have seven times more accidents per million kilometres driven than men in their fifties. 
Young women have fewer <tag "532675">accidents</> than young men, but after the age of 30, the position is reversed.

I have given general support to the ambulance staffs' claim for their pay to have a similar linking system, because experience shows this is the most satisfactory way of conducting negotiations for people whose work is of such vital importance to the nation's safety. 
Whatever other differences exist in the nature of their work, when the police, fire and ambulance services work together at the scene of <tag "532675">accidents</>, there is no doubt they are a team, with identical objectives, attracting identical public expectations.

Staff in the area have since voted to step up their action by withdrawing emergency cover on New Year's Eve, the time of the year when the service is most stretched. 
While nationally the number of 999 calls over the Christmas period seemed to be down on last year and staff in nearly all areas provided cover, services are gearing up for the new year celebrations when excess alcohol normally means a high number of road <tag "532675">accidents</> and more public disorder.

Monica Purves was the first to recognize the woman: Mrs Poole (for such it was) came sometimes to clean for her as she did, evidently, for Ms Jekyll. 
`Oh, Miss Purves!" Mrs Poole seized hold of the stockbroker's sleeve, as if in need of something to help her keep her balance. 
`There's been a terrible <tag "532675">accident</>!

THE domestic <tag "532675">accident</> which left Warrington's Paul Bishop needing 20 stitches in a gashed arm only hours before the second Silk Cut Challenge Cup semi-final, could have proved far more costly than the price of a new window pane.

The grass area is regularly used by about 50 children in the neighbourhood and Mrs Trinder feels that if it is taken away they may end up playing in the road. 
Her son William was involved in an <tag "532675">accident</> with a lorry outside his home last year, and she is worried that there will be more children hurt if the grass play area disappears.   

800365
Rain asked: `Hasn't he got another song he could sing instead?" 
As if he had heard her, Cowboy cut short the first song and his twangy guitar brought them one about `The Siege of Barnsbury' in which all ended happily with the S A S swinging through the window and saving everybody, except those who got killed by <tag "532676">accident</>. 

800366
The numbers of projects and donors in individual countries is a source of confusion for which donors themselves are almost entirely responsible. 
Even the World Bank regularly despatches different missions to an individual country unaware of each others' presence, or who may meet by <tag "532676">accident</> in a permanent secretary's outer office.   

800367
Suffice it to say, however, that later legislative efforts to deal with these same problems over a protracted period have ended in complete failure due to the prevailing deadlock between the two professional interest groups. 
One of the more intriguing puzzles is that American courts have not tried to emulate the widespread Continental option of strict liability for motoring <tag "532675">accidents</>.

He said: `I think the one fact that has struck all of us is that six men, all of whom knew of the hazards of overhead cables to a greater or lesser extent, visited the site on various occasions and either did not see the lines, or if they did, they failed to register the significance of them." 
`All of them, when they saw the lines after the <tag "532675">accident</>, immediately knew what had happened."

If horses are to be housed indoors, faint illumination at night is preferable, and a shielded twenty-five watt electric light can be arranged to give about the same amount of illumination as a nearly full moon.

This so-called `collateral source rule" is far more categorical and far-reaching than the ambivalent and vacillating posture of English and Commonwealth courts.

Each is the good king, the shepherd of his people, and yet each has laboured from birth under a curse; their actions must reflect this double destiny, and hence their character acquires a double aspect. 
It is by an <tag "532674">accident</> that these three characters acquire individuality, an accident that may be called the beginning of character-study in European drama.

Throwing caution to the winds, a host of western painters risked all, relying only on the present. 
The high regard which so many postwar artists held for the acceptance of <tag "532674">accident</>, intuition and spontaneity was also fuelled by the deification of the subconscious.

But the continuous scrutiny demanded and enforced by regulation of the high-risk cases and (for nuclear reactors) the designs of these installations are considerable forces on the side of safety. 
One day there will be a serious industrial accident; there are occasional near misses and worse; but it usually takes a good measure of folly, inattention and misfortune to overwhelm good plant and a safe system. 
Relatively few members of the public have been killed in Britain by industrial <tag "532675">accidents</> in recent years.

Also worrying was the fact that only 12 per cent of those replying to the survey reported any form of training in handling violence.

SHANE SUTTON will ride into Liverpool today in the yellow jersey of Milk Race leader. 
Sutton, the Australian captain of Britain's Banana-Falcon professional team, held his 2min 40sec overall lead when yesterday's 73.5-mile penultimate stage from Lancaster to Salford ended in another massed sprint finish contested by 64 of the 75 survivors. 
For the ninth day running he will don the leader's jersey before the start of today's 82.2-mile final leg from Manchester to Liverpool and, barring <tag "532674 or 532675">accidents</>, he will surely take the major prize.

The ship is conventionally-powered, has a crew of 500 and its home port is currently Gaeta, in Italy. 
The problem with the Belknap is that earlier this year Greenpeace researchers revealed that in 1975 the ship had a whacking collision with the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the resulting fire came close to blowing up a magazine containing nuclear weapons. 
The navy, which tried to cover up the <tag "532675">accident</>, spent dollars 300m (#200m) over five years in repairs.

Even more unusual was that the defence bar for once made common cause with the plaintiffs', in defence of the common law adversary system and against its own traditional clients of the insurance industry. 
Proposals for introducing a system of no-fault liability for traffic <tag "532675">accidents</> in America go back to the early decades of this century, stimulated by the model of workers' compensation and early legislation in Europe.

LARGE-SCALE plans for evacuating thousands of people in the event of an accident at nuclear power stations are to be developed by local authorities, the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear Installations disclosed yesterday, writes Paul Brown. 
Until now emergency plans have only been for small accidents, with the possibility of anything on the scale of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl officially discounted. 
Now the Health and Safety Executive is preparing regulations to be put before Parliament which will give local authorities a statutory duty to prepare evacuation plans for the population in the event of a nuclear <tag "532675">accident</>.

Ford, 19, reversed out of the space near his home in St James, Wantage, and then went forward at speed, hitting the heel of the boy who was playing football with a friend on the pavement. 
The boy was taken to hospital after the accident but did not need treatment. 
Ford admitted driving while unsupervised; driving without due care and attention; failing to display L plates; having no insurance; failing to stop after an <tag "532675">accident</> and failing to report the accident.

A decision by parliament this summer to exempt advanced students from military service cost it 175,000 of its best and brightest conscripts. 
After 20 civilians were killed by soldiers as they dispersed a peaceful demonstration in Georgia last April, demands by many non-Russian republics for separate national units threaten the military's role as unifier of a disparate, multi-ethnic country. 
Glasnost has exposed myriad incidents, ranging from a string of submarine <tag "532675">accidents</> to indiscipline and barracks brutality, sometimes along ethnic lines.   

800438
Yet another proposal has been to protect a defendant from more than one award. 
In order to test the sincerity of the trial lawyers who are wont to defend punitive damages as a needed spur to <tag "538889">accident</> prevention, a most provocative reform would be to divert punitive damages from the plaintiff to humanitarian purposes such as organizations devoted to industrial safety and accident prevention, the Red Cross, and the like.   

800439
Many of the insurances are first-party and adjustable to the individual's needs unlike the flat benefits under most centralized social security systems. 
Likewise, premiums are fine-tuned to reflect exposure to risk instead of being flat-rated and are in this and other respects more sensitive to the problems of `moral hazard". 
This contrast is particularly noticeable in the different approaches to motor-traffic <tag "532675">accidents</>: while the traditional European method has followed the original workers' compensation model of third-party insurance or a central compensation fund, the unique American solution has been simply to convert voluntary into compulsory first-party insurance.

There is a further factor to be considered.

800443
In my wife's teaching days in the heavy-woollen district of Yorkshire an inspector, quite famous in his day, suggested that she take her class of 48 eight-year-old boys round one of the local mills. 
In spite of, or perhaps because of, his literary and poetic background, he seemed to have no idea of the conditions in `the dark satanic mills" with their flying shuttles and clattering looms which precluded all normal speech and helped to give rise to that much exaggerated mouthing of words to facilitate lip-reading: a technique exploited by such North Country comedians as Norman Evans and Les Dawson. 
Had this suggestion been taken up and an <tag "532675">accident</> occurred I doubt if the parents' grief would have been assuaged by the return of their child woven into a suit length, however fine the worsted.

Yet even the Ferrari driver has only a win and a second place out of seven races so far in a season which has seen British hopes plunge because of injury and recalcitrant machinery.

800445
The California Court, by a precarious majority, upheld the limitation on non-pecuniary damages to $250,000 as also conformable to the requirement of due process, noting that `thoughtful jurists and legal scholars have for some time questioned the wisdom of damages for pain and suffering in negligence actions", that the legislature was within its rights to conclude that it was in the public interest to obtain some cost savings by this device, and that, in any event, it knew of `no principle of California &dash. or federal &dash. constitutional law which prohibits the Legislature from limiting the recovery of damages in a particular setting in order to further a legitimate state interest". 
In support it relied on the US Supreme Court's upholding the limit in a federal statute on liability in the event of a nuclear <tag "532675">accident</>.

Yet women drivers have the last laugh. 
They get cheaper insurance rates because their <tag "538889">accident</> records are better; they have fewer problems with their cars because they don't thrash them; and they probably expend far less nervous energy when they are driving, because they treat it like any other domestic activity.

Mr Parkinson had `fiddled the statistics" to make the accident record seem worse under Labour and better under the Conservatives. 
The Transport Secretary was a `Tory Luddite" who had `denied us the opportunity now of achieving a high-speed link to the Channel Tunnel", he said.

But reaction by the insurance industry to the well-documented rise in awards during the past two decades was belated, and, when it occurred, seemed to be the more dramatic because of an understandable effort to recoup past losses. 
Significantly, the `crises" were confined to the volatile areas of liability &dash. products and medical malpractice &dash. whereas in traditional areas, like traffic <tag "532675">accidents</>, awards and premiums remained stable.

A radioactive release on the scale of Chernobyl at the advanced gas cooled reactors at Heysham, Lancashire, or Hartlepool, Cleveland, would result in a high number of casualties and the need to abandon large urban areas indefinitely, said the report, by Philip Steadman of the Open University and Simon Hodgkinson of Earth Resources Research. 
The authors said models of a nuclear accident at Sizewell B in Suffolk showed that up to 5,000 square kilometres would be contaminated. 
An <tag "532675">accident</> at Sizewell spreading radioactivity across 2,700 square kilometres would result in 1.5 million people having to be evacuated.

As Senna raced towards the victory he needed in Spain on Sunday, James Hunt, a driver familiar with the pressures of a late challenge for the championship, was saying Senna had no right to be on the track at all. 
Or, at least, not if you compare Senna's comparatively lenient fine for ignoring a warning flag last Friday with the harsh justice delivered to Nigel Mansell earlier in the week. 
The argument is that Senna's crime as he rushed past the scene of an <tag "532675">accident</> was infinitely more dangerous than Mansell's failure to stop on the command of a black flag.

Thus, both the law and insurance practice have done a good deal, especially in the more recent past, to improve the compensation record. 
Awards in motor <tag "538889">accident</> litigation have remained relatively modest in comparison with the high-flying medical malpractice or products liability awards, probably because juries have been made well aware of the long-term effect of inflated verdicts on the level of their own insurance premiums.

The visit, organised with the co-operation of the Soviet authorities, will allow the inquiry to learn how the Soviet Union organised the emergency evacuation of thousands of people three years ago, and what contamination and health problems remain 40 months after the world's worst civil nuclear power station accident.

First to give evidence was Mr Watts, representing himself, who made a lengthy statement on why he had made the accusations. 
He began by hoping Lord Aldington would `make a speedy recovery" from his injuries, but shortly afterwards he thumped the rail of the witness box and said that he knew him to be `ruthless, calculating, cunning and evasive". 
Mr Watts described how his sister had been left penniless and desperate after the Sun Alliance Insurance Company, and its chairman, Lord Aldington, had refused to pay out on an <tag "538889">accident</> insurance policy on her husband because he had not revealed that he had been treated on several occasions for excessive drinking.

Not so, says Mr Carr. 
Many drivers were thinking twice about carrying out risky manoeuvres such as doing 90 miles an hour down the motorway even though such speeds benefited society in speeding up access to distant parts.

There is no real evidence that the fox population is kept down by the hunts.

Comin Thro" the Rye (1922), for example, exploits the beauties of the English countryside and constructs an allegorical subtext out of the changing seasons, but the narrative approach dilutes the dramatic potential inherent in its tale of a simple girl robbed of her true love by a heartless flirt, the sort of woman who is `very useful for amusing men on rainy days." 
The passivity of the wronged girl is a trait she shares with the hero of Guy Newell's Fox Farm (1922), a sensitive farmer abandoned by his go-getting wife after he has been blinded in an explosion.

But insurers still have no idea of the true cost of covering `no fault" liability. 
Abta head of public affairs David Hurst points out that the problem must be put in context: `Out of more than 12 million package holidays sold in a good year, we would regard 50 cases where the tour operator is proved to be liable, following <tag "538895">accident</> or injury, as bad. 

800597
In any event, important industries whose social utility obviously outweighs the risk their activities portend to public safety would no longer be faced with the ever present threat of extinction. 
By internalizing the compensation cost to the risk-creating enterprise or industry, some `general deterrence" can be preserved in the interest of <tag "538889">accident</> prevention.

He tore a page from his notebook, offered it with a pencil to Sharpe, then volunteered his own patrol to take the despatch to General Dornberg's headquarters in Mons. 
Dornberg was the General in charge of these cavalry patrols which watched the French frontier, and finding one of his officers had been a stroke of luck for Sharpe; by pure <tag "532676-x">accident</> he had come across the very men whose job was to alert the allies of any French advance.

The two incidents concentrated attention on the poor safety record of the Soviet fleet. 
A few days before the Mike accident, a Soviet submarine captain, based at Northern Fleet's headquarters in Murmansk, wrote in a trade union paper that many crew were so poorly trained that `they know and can cope with only 30 to 50 per cent of what they should be capable of handling".

Another theory comes from the serious Australian Magazine  journalist Frank Robson. 
`The attitude seems to be that as  Minogue was `invented" by the publicity machine anyway, she's  fair game, no matter how flimsy or outrageous the angle. 
As a  result some publications no longer deal in real information  at all, except occasionally by <tag "532676">accident</>."

But the continuous scrutiny demanded and enforced by regulation of the high-risk cases and (for nuclear reactors) the designs of these installations are considerable forces on the side of safety.

In reality, of course, they are the result of a long chain of conscious decision making.

The courts may grant a jury trial in other cases, but this discretion is rarely exercised.

The new standard had been admitted long ago in cases of intentional infliction of mental disturbance{fo id=198} and more recently for relational claims by spouses. 
The practical result of this decision was to abandon the last judicial control over juries in these cases and to recognize a cause of action for negligent `pain and suffering" without physical injury. 
American law shares with English law the common law tradition of lump sum awards, once and for all, for both past and future losses{fo id=201} sustained in a single <tag "532675">accident</>.

Of what possible use to anybody are such figures? 
The fact that accidents are now apparently more expensive to cope with will not enable us to set ourselves a county budget of accidents, allowing only so many per year. 
And whether the number of <tag "532675">accidents</> increases or decreases is immaterial so far as provision of police, fire crews, ambulance crews and hospitals is concerned.

`Anyway, when I found out how well-known he was, I made sure the first spot was very organised. 
It was about how to deal with road <tag "532675">accident</> and I arranged for a smashed-up car to be towed into the studio, and for actors to sprawl around, made-up to look as if they had appalling injuries.

But they had later tested one of their own cars in similar circumstances with the intention of inducing skids, and had found themselves unable to do so on all but one occasion despite `extreme" handling of the vehicle. 
One of these officers, PC Peter Chandler, a member of the force's <tag "538889">accident</> investigation unit, said he had seen a sign warning of a slippery road surface some time after the accident, but could not say whether it had been there on the day in question.

None the less, over 85 per cent of the population are covered by private medical insurance, though not all of these for long-term chronic illness. 
In addition to workers' compensation, a number of states require non-occupational disability insurance,{fo id=102} many have enacted no-fault automobile insurance, and federal legislation has experimented with several compensation plans for special injuries, notably black lung disease{fo id=103} and now vaccine injuries,{fo id=104} as well as making itself responsible for excess insurance for nuclear accidents. 
Other special compensation plans have been proposed for a great variety of <tag "532675">accidents</>, from medical{fo id=106} and toxic-chemical injuries to extension of workers' compensation{fo id=108} or temporary disability insurance for twenty-four hour coverage.

An even more radical role for class actions is envisaged by Professor David Rosenberg. 
Admitting the cogency of the widespread criticism of the tort system as too cumbersome, costly, and haphazard to accomplish its accident prevention and compensation objectives{fo id=61} with respect to sporadic accidents like automobile collisions, he contends that mass accidents are peculiarly amenable to tort treatment in class actions. 
Inasmuch as these <tag "532675">accidents</> are frequently the result of deliberate business decisions balancing safety against profits, they should be especially amenable to control through threats of liability; while their massive scale and statistical predictability render them peculiarly suitable for aggregative rather than case-by-case adjudication.

Thus illegitimacy is no longer taken into consideration in determining the rights of succession of an illegitimate person, or the rights of succession to his estate, or the rights of succession traced through an illegitimate relationship. 
Again, illegitimate relations are included among the dependants who are entitled to claim compensation for the death of a person caused by an <tag "532675">accident</> at work.

But Mr John Read of Oxfordshire County Council's surveyors department says a lower limit would be unrealistic and that the proposed 50mph speed is reasonable for motorists.

THE MOST moving occasion of this and possibly any other Flat season was the ovation accorded to Dick Hern after Nashwan galloped off with the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. 
The British have a natural empathy with underdogs and the Major's much chronicled counter-attack against the ravages of outrageous fortune increased his stature from a man who commanded total respect professionally to one who also had the hearts of the British nation beating for him. 
Yesterday, at the presentation of the annual Derby awards conferred by the Horserace Writers' Association, Hern provided an even more poignant moment when he got out of the wheelchair to which he has been confined since his hunting <tag "532675">accident</> several years ago, to accept the award for Flat trainer of the year and offered a heartfelt and witty speech that showed a hitherto unrevealed side to his character.

For most people in Britain, the Medical Research Council's study, published in February 1990, revealing the strong possibility that fathers who worked in the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria had passed leukaemia to their children in their sperm, moved speculation out of the realms of the circumstantial into that of the confirmed.

Most pervasively it has stimulated the search for `deep pockets" on behalf of claimants victimized by tortfeasors without assets. 
The high percentage of un- or under-insured tortfeasors, even in motor-car <tag "532675">accidents</>, ensures that the accident cost is in practice often met by defendants, such as municipal authorities responsible for street maintenance, whose share of fault may be negligible.

The Personal Emergency Response Sustem (Persy) is a pocket computer developed by the National Chemical Emergency Centre, at Harwell, providing information to emergency services such as the potential hazards from dangerous chemicals so that appropriate action can be taken in the event of a fire or spillage. 
Persy, the sales of which have exceeded expectations since it was launched six months ago, provides key information how to deal with chemical hazards. 
On arriving at the scene of an <tag "532675">accident</>, the operator enters details of the chemical or chemicals involved and the computer displays appropriate courses of action, including what has to be done to protect people involved.

From two of the three important <tag "538889">accident</> areas &dash. work injuries{fo id=58} and defective products{fo id=59} &dash. the plaintiff's contributory fault had been virtually expelled, so that the defence in any event played only a lingering role in road and other residuary accidents.

According to a widely held view, which is also shared by Commonwealth courts,{fo id=21} mass tort cases do not qualify because claims for damages, unlike injunctions in antitrust cases and the like, are predicated upon the unique features of each individual case, affecting causation no less than the quantum of damages.

After efforts to procure reform by legislation were foiled by the plaintiffs' bar and its legislative supporters, a popular initiative eventually approved a measure (dubbed the `deep pocket" proposition) to eliminate the `joint and several liability" rule with respect at least to claims for non-economic loss. 
What turned the scales in this instance was that popular opposition to the rule could be enlisted because of its immediate fiscal impact on taxpayers as a result of its application against local government bodies for road hazards which may have contributed only a minor share in respect of <tag "532675">accidents</> by un- or under-insured drivers.   

801172
The county council says they will slow traffic down to make life safer for pedestrians.

It is almost impossible to argue with the call for safety, as members of the World Motor Sport Council found when asked to address the matter of Mulsanne and back Balestre's proposal. 
According to the influential British magazine Autosport, Balestre asked council members if they would take personal responsibility for any serious <tag "532675">accidents</> were the race to be held next June.

`It's a misunderstanding of the situation to see it as herd instinct," said Kemal, aged 29, a railway worker until recently.

The bill for the damage would be settled between the hunt's insurers and his company's insurers, he said. 
Secretary of the Bicester Hunt with Whaddon Chase, Mr Robert Vallance said:`The Bicester Hunt are very sorry indeed that this accident took place and I personally apologised to the driver Mr Olejnik on behalf of the hunt." 
`I exchanged insurance details with Mr Olejnik as one would normally do in the case of a motor <tag "532675">accident</> on the public highway and I waited with him to make sure he was alright."

Standing on the same royal balcony as Marie Antoinette herself 200 years ago, she and the two royal children (played, incidentally, by Ms Seymour's own kids), are facing a mob of extras throwing rocks and waving severed aristocratic heads on pikes. 
At one point an extra discharges his musket with a deafening bang.

Difficult adjustments during a protracted transitional period did not deter the introduction of comparative fault or strict products liability. 
Perhaps closer to the truth is that no-fault compensation for motor traffic <tag "532675">accidents</> had moved to the forefront of the legislative agenda and become a contentious public issue.

I mean, there is no such thing as, the day starts for Jimmy White around nine o'clock at night, and if Jimmy's drawn the afternoons, he should be asleep, he's that sort of character.

According to Dr Clive Nussey, deputy director of the HSE's engineering laboratories, there will eventually be a family, which, unlike Pete, (a white caucasian) will be good for designing equipment for different ethnic groups. 
With 1992 on the horizon, the HSE is also hoping for collaboration abroad to come up with a standard European head form as well. 
Dr Nussey says that industrial <tag "532675">accidents</> cost the nation up to #3bn every year, and some happen because safety gear is not used properly, if at all. 

801197
A small backlog of calls that had built up because of the walkout was cleared almost immediately, Mr Crosby said.

In the nineteenth century the stagnant waters  of cities were haunted by the shadow of cholera. 
It is no <tag "532674">accident</> that many slums  were built on marshes: Mosside in Manchester, the Bogside in Londonderry, and  much of the East End of London, where the suffix `ey" to many of the placenames tell us that they were islands in Saxon times: Hackney, Stepney, and, most  notorious of all, Bermondsey, where, in the 1850s, the river Neckinger, {deadGuys}, flowed round Jacob's lsland, which was used by  Dickens as a setting for Oliver Twist, and was described by him as {deadGuys}.

The figure, disclosed in a new booklet produced by the Oxfordshire county surveyor and engineer Mr John Peverel-Cooper, is #40,000 a day more than last year. 
The battle against rising road accidents could only be properly fought, he said, if people took more care.

Churchill brought in two new men: Beaverbrook, now his intimate adviser, as minister of aircraft production; Bevin, secretary of the transport and general workers' union, as minister of labour. 
It was no <tag "532674">accident</> that these two provided, after Churchill himself, most of the drive and also most of the trouble during the next two years.   

801212
In addition it is difficult to attribute more errors or a poorer performance wholly to the effects of a body clock. 
Consider the problems of traffic accidents more closely. 
If it were found that more <tag "532675">accidents</> occurred in the winter months between 6 and 8 o'clock in the evening compared with noon and 2 o'clock, is this because, during the early evening, lighting is worse, there is more traffic, drivers have been working longer and are more tired, or weather conditions are worse?

it may never even have occurred to you. 
But serious <tag "532675">accidents</> can and do happen every day of the year.

Northern Ireland Railways said the investigation team's report would be submitted later to the railways inspectorate. 
Northern Ireland Railways has an impressive track safety record, but last night's <tag "532675">accident</> was the fifth in a four-year series involving unmanned level crossings on this particular stretch of line in the province's north-west.  

801219
Of what possible use to anybody are such figures? 
The fact that <tag "532675">accidents</> are now apparently more expensive to cope with will not enable us to set ourselves a county budget of accidents, allowing only so many per year.

These, it must be remembered, include not only lawyers' fees of successful claimants but also the cost to defendants of successfully resisting claims &dash. a factor that has been most influential in persuading defendants to settle rather than continuing a spree of pyrrhic victories.

Although some electronic ice-detection systems do exist already, Plessey believes its device has an edge because it is simple and no complex control circuits are needed. 
Pilots, Plessey says, like the idea of a rapid indication of conditions when they fly in and out of clouds. 
The sensor may not prevent <tag "532675">accidents</>, but it could mean that they can fly more often than was previously the case.   

801223
The Plan will pay substantial cash benefits directly to you, free  of income tax under current Inland Revenue regulations, if you  are permanently disabled as a result of an accident. 
And even if you already have private medical insurance and life  insurance, you may still need Lloyds Bank Accident Cashguard. 
Because neither life insurance nor private health plans normally  cover you against the financial consequences of a seriously  disabling <tag "532675">accident</>.

Working party members covered a wide range of surgical specialties. 
It is critical of those designated specialist theatres which are used as little as twice a week; of having too many <tag "538889">accident</> departments when it would be more efficent to concentrate on a major centre; and of poor planning which overburdens recovery facilities when surgeons undertake too many short operations in a session.

They are not particularly apt at dealing with issues determination of which depends on the way different alternatives affect whole communities over long periods.

He added: `It's a classic example of a decision motivated by commerce rather than safety."

The breakdown of accidents, produced for only the second time in booklet form, is being distributed in thousands to colleges, community groups, libraries and health authorities. 
The figures show there were 2,616 injury accidents in Oxfordshire last year with a drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries but a rise in the number of people slightly injured. 
Mr Peverel-Cooper's breakdown shows 68 per cent happened during the day with 15-24 year olds more likely to be involved in <tag "532675">accidents</> due to their `lack of experience and poorly developed road sense."

What we should be hearing from Labour is an appeal for common sense, an appeal for negotiation to be resumed. 
`Nupe and the trade unions concerned should show some compassion to the people of London and honour their commitment to maintain the <tag "538889">accident</> and emergency service and get back to the negotiating table."

The Oxford ring road is beginning to ease as is the A forty this evening. 
The A four one three in Buckinghamshire at Dunton turn between Winslow and Whitchurch did see two mile tailbacks earlier on this afternoon, at that was Aylesbury-bound due to the accident involving a car on fire. 
The tailbacks are now beginning to ease I'm told by Thames Valley Police, due to the <tag "532675?">accident</> being cleared away from the carriageway at the moment.

What, then, of Oxford's sixth and last-remaining Church Street, named for St. Ebbe's Church? 
Although its disappearance was more by <tag "532676">accident</> than design, most people who have watched the changes in central Oxford over the last 30 years can guess what happened.

Mr Prescott yesterday demanded to know why the official report in 1986 took no account of draft studies published in 1985 which concluded that `gross fatigue in the general area of the forward extremity of the superstructure" may have contributed to the <tag "532675">accident</>.   

801245
Northamptonshire County Council proposes to build the bypass and improve the section of the A422 road by Overthorpe Hall, a preparatory day school on the outskirts of the village. 
The county council has made it a priority to build the bypass because of the amount of <tag "532675">accidents</> which have taken place in and around Middleton Cheney.

In a letter declaring no confidence in management, the consultant surgeons have told Dr Ken Grant, the authority's manager, that the 36 per cent cut in surgical beds means `we will be unable to offer an emergency service". 
With the bulk of surgical patients consisting of urgent conditions, from cancers to vascular disease, Richard Wood, Professor of Surgery, has told Dr Grant that such surgery cannot be halted. 
The surgeons, he said, are `unanimous" that there is `no alternative to the closure of the <tag "538889">accident</> and emergency department".

Through every step of the campaign he was dogged by questions about Chappaquiddick, newspaper articles and TV specials kept the issue alive with the public and Mr Kennedy subsequently lost the nomination to Mr Carter who went down to a landslide defeat at the hands of Ronald Reagan.

At the start of the year, Hern was admired for his professional excellence, but regarded by the public as an aloof, reclusive figure. 
However, his fightback against a crippling injury from a hunting <tag "532675">accident</>, which was followed by heart surgery and a royal slap in the face over the termination of his lease, brought out the traditional British championing of the underdog. 

801256
